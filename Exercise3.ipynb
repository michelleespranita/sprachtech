      "The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence'' that any irregularities took place.\n",
      "The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge of the election, `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta'' for the manner in which the election was conducted.\n",
      "The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities'' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr..\n",
      "The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous''.\n",
      "It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them''.\n",
      "The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments''.\n",
      "However, the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration''.\n",
      "It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy'' this problem.\n",
      "It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected''.\n",
      "`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program'', the jury said, but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money.\n",
      "Nevertheless, `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds'', the jurors said.\n",
      "`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden'' on Fulton taxpayers.\n",
      "`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms'', the jury said.\n",
      "Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences''.\n",
      "The jury did not elaborate, but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable''.\n",
      "On other matters, the jury recommended that:( 1)\n",
      "Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable'' pension plan for city employes.\n",
      "Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon.\n",
      "The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.\n",
      "His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923.\n",
      "He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr., who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.\n",
      "Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.\n",
      "State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker.\n",
      "In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.\n",
      "Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.\n",
      "When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no -- and there were no dissents.\n",
      "The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses must be taken: 1\n",
      "Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or 2\n",
      "Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director, resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign.\n",
      "When the gubernatorial campaign starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd.\n",
      "Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made.\n",
      "Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.\n",
      "Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds.\n",
      "The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways.\n",
      "A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.\n",
      "The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities.\n",
      "The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.\n",
      "Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.\n",
      "Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie'' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.\n",
      "While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.\n",
      "As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action.\n",
      "Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.\n",
      "A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently opposed in the past.\n",
      "Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education, provided that such funds be received and expended'' as state funds.\n",
      "Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator, said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it( the resolution) passed''.\n",
      "But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution.\n",
      "It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds'', the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority'' to teacher pay raises.\n",
      "Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.\n",
      "The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however.\n",
      "The former county school superintendent, George P. Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.\n",
      "Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.\n",
      "Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.\n",
      "Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.\n",
      "Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week.\n",
      "But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.\n",
      "Daniel termed `` extremely conservative'' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.\n",
      "It permits the state to take over bank accounts, stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more.\n",
      "The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally, would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer.\n",
      "The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property, Daniel declared.\n",
      "Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.\n",
      "`` If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something to the economy'', he said.\n",
      "Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance and pipeline companies''.\n",
      "Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional'' since, he said, it would impair contracts.\n",
      "He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only last Monday.\n",
      "The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.\n",
      "There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House.\n",
      "It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.\n",
      "The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.\n",
      "Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E.( Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.\n",
      "While details are still to be worked out, Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected.\n",
      "I'm willing to stake my political career on it''.\n",
      "A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard sledding later.\n",
      "The house passed finally, and sent to the Senate, a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities.\n",
      "One, by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.\n",
      "Instead, retailers would sign a certificate of correctness, violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison, plus a $1,000 fine.\n",
      "Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain, under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3, of El Paso, to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas.\n",
      "Marshall Formby of Plainview, former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission, suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress, eliminating the need for costly special elections.\n",
      "-- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay.\n",
      "An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U.S. senator.\n",
      "Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill.\n",
      "The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22.\n",
      "The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval, by two-thirds majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.\n",
      "Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.\n",
      "-- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.\n",
      "Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people.\n",
      "When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas.\n",
      "The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project.\n",
      "Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.\n",
      "Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.\n",
      "Rep. Henry C. Grover, who teaches history in the Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods'' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate.\n",
      "Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching.\n",
      "`` A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted to teach in the public schools'', said Grover.\n",
      "College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses.\n",
      "State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon'' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.\n",
      "The report, culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load.\n",
      "The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C. Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott& Co., committee chairman.\n",

      "The volume of ADC cases will decrease, Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color.\n",

      "The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.\n",
      "Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial.\n",
      "`` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client'', Bellows told the court.\n",

      "-- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.\n",
      "Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go'' toward completion.\n",
      "Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, replied, `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts''.\n",
      "Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.\n",
      "The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means''.\n",
      "Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence'' of the 50 persons.\n",
      "Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.\n",
      "In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case''.\n",
      "Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury.\n",
      "Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.\n",
      "Karns said it was a `` wrongful act'' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room''.\n",
      "`` Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court'', said Karns, who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court.\n",
      "Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons.\n",
      "Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary'' miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.\n",
      "After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them.\n",
      "-- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.\n",
      "The President, in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research.\n",
      "The aged care plan, similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol hill.\n",
      "Cost up to $37 a year\n",
      "The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each.\n",
      "The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.\n",
      "Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963.\n",
      "Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years.\n",
      "Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.\n",
      "Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.\n",
      "A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula'' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit.\n",
      "Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness.\n",
      "The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.\n",
      "He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay''.\n",
      "`` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs'', he said, `` and with sufficient' deductible' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.\n",
      "Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.\n",
      "The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care.\n",
      "Contributions to schools\n",
      "The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.\n",
      "The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.\n",
      "In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education'' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants.\n",
      "Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.\n",
      "He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial'' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants'' to states to improve nursing homes.\n",
      "He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute.\n",
      "The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.\n",
      "For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching grants for building research facilities.\n",
      "The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people, knowledge, services, facilities, and the means to pay for them''.\n",
      "Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.\n",
      "Senate Republican Leader Dirksen( Ill.) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck( Ind.) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.\n",
      "Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.\n",
      "In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.\n",
      "The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings.\n",
      "This has been a working session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.\n",
      "In Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.\n",
      "The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicuous by its absence.\n",
      "In the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.\n",
      "There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes, since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.\n",
      "Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive.\n",
      "Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance, is today closer to the NATO line.\n",
      "On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.\n",
      "But he hastened to add that, if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy.\n",
      "A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited.\n",
      "The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days, despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity, that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.\n",
      "The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months.\n",
      "But where the core of NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance, `` cornerstone'' of its foreign policy, but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters.\n",
      "The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole.\n",
      "The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.\n",
      "The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper, and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development( when ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries, and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.\n",
      "This increase in the `` threshold'', as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come.\n",
      "Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.\n",
      "There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.\n",
      "They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this.\n",
      "The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated.\n",
      "But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.\n",
      "The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference.\n",
      "This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make.\n",
      "It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.\n",
      "Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.\n",
      "He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.\n",
      "It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it.\n",
      "One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score.\n",
      "His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.\n",
      "But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first.\n",
      "The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton( R) of Kentucky, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination.\n",
      "This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups''.\n",
      "It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations;;\n",
      "But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.\n",
      "Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors.\n",
      "Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels, a high official source disclosed, that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.\n",
      "Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.\n",
      "Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.\n",
      "In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture.\n",
      "Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze'' the military situation in Laos.\n",
      "But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.\n",
      "There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.\n",
      "The pro-Western government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist'' government, never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.\n",
      "There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.\n",
      "If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.\n",
      "He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal'' of Prince Souvanna.\n",
      "The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.\n",
      "In an important assertion of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.\n",
      "The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.\n",
      "The President has also called upon the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.\n",
      "Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett, a special assistant to the Attorney General, as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.\n",
      "His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.\n",
      "Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally'' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.\n",
      "Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program, Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.\n",
      "He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.\n",
      "Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job.\n",
      "Along with a director, the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.\n",
      "One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program.\n",
      "Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks, similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station.\n",
      "He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area.\n",
      "Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.\n",
      "Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point.\n",
      "Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack.\n",
      "Such vital information, he said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know.\n",
      "If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director, Mr. Hawksley said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally.\n",
      "One of the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in first aid.\n",
      "Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government.\n",
      "Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind.\n",
      "Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly.\n",
      "The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law'' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls.\n",
      "A copy was released to the press.\n",
      "Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant.\n",
      "The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature.\n",
      "While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review, Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views''.\n",
      "`` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings'', Mr. Notte said, `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws''.\n",
      "The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales''.\n",
      "The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws.\n",
      "The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.\n",
      "The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.\n",
      "The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday'', the council's resolution said.\n",
      "The small shops `` must be retained, for they provide essential service to the community'', according to the resolution, which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors''.\n",
      "It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue'' to the local government.\n",
      "The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets, factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business'' on Sunday.\n",
      "They `` operate on a volume basis'', it was contended, `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community''.\n",
      "Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare'' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system.\n",
      "He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day.\n",
      "He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910''.\n",
      "He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track''.\n",
      "He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources.\n",
      "He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties.\n",
      "Mr. Reama, who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said, `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it''.\n",
      "He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze'' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.\n",
      "A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.\n",
      "William A. Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr..\n",
      "The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post.\n",
      "Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.\n",
      "He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work.\n",
      "Mr. Martinelli has, in recent weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote, while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead.\n",
      "Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures.\n",
      "He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible.\n",
      "Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement.\n",
      "He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.\n",
      "`` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement''.\n",
      "`` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement'', he indicated, `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town''.\n",
      "He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September.\n",
      "Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.\n",
      "Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses''.\n",
      "Several signers affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.\n",
      "Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.\n",
      "Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance.\n",
      "At the last session of the General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.\n",
      "Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.\n",
      "At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition.\n",
      "Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.\n",
      "-- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial candidate, that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism''.\n",
      "Hughes said Monday, `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired.\n",
      "Now he's gone, the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state''.\n",
      "The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy'' while working in his adminstration.\n",
      "Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue.\n",
      "`` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign'', he said, `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign''.\n",
      "The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.\n",
      "State aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and making New Jersey attractive to new industry.\n",
      "Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant, he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform.\n",
      "Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs for Mitchell.\n",
      "He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.\n",
      "The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real estate or motor vehicles, he said, `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue''.\n",
      "`` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes.\n",
      "His reference to' discredited carcass' or' tattered remains' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States, and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations.\n",
      "`` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste.\n",
      "`` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.\n",
      "It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit''.\n",
      "Sen. Charles W. Sandman, R-Cape May, said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination.\n",
      "Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.\n",
      "Sandman said: `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj, has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway.\n",
      "It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems.\n",
      "`` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington.\n",
      "`` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year.\n",
      "County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets, who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them.\n",
      "The proposal, Sheets said, represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word''.\n",
      "Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge.\n",
      "Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January, 1964.\n",

      "In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said, `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.\n",
      "But we'll have a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform.\n",
      "`` We'll take the truth to the people, and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November''.\n",
      "But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead''.\n",
      "He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy''.\n",
      "He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry.\n",
      "Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people'', Hughes asked, `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November''.\n",
      "He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday.\n",
      "The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.\n",
      "Hughes said, `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it'', pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950.\n",
      "He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no land left to preserve''.\n",
      "He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans.\n",

      "Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates.\n",
      "At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable.\n",
      "Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years.\n",
      "The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders.\n",
      "Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party.\n",
      "Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary.\n",

      "Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.\n",
      "There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session, it will really throw his administration into a scramble.\n",

      "The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress, in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent.\n",
      "The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.\n",
      "But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation.\n",
      "Indeed, the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat.\n",
      "Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy.\n",
      "If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration.\n",

      "This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.\n",
      "They would like to convey the notion something is being done, even though it is something they know to be ineffectual.\n",
      "Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition.\n",
      "He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle.\n",
      "Then he could tell them to go home, while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period.\n",
      "It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million, since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one.\n",
      "But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program, a not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes.\n",
      "If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.\n",
      "Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.\n",
      "In either case, it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.\n",
      "It is one that most try to avoid, as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem.\n",
      "But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.\n",
      "This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.\n",
      "A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize.\n",
      "Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.\n",

      "`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way''.\n",
      "Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself, for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star, Jack Spikes, though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury.\n",
      "`` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well'', said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game.\n",
      "`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack'', explained Stram.\n",
      "The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans, but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.\n",

      "Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner, Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies.\n",
      "Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play.\n",
      "The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark.\n",

      "The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home.\n",
      "Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy.\n",
      "This year, I am told, the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here.\n",
      "It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good, especially at the minor league level.\n",
      "This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game.\n",
      "With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers, the most ever used by one team in a series game.\n",

      "The 53-year-old Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background, is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York.\n",
      "Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley, Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea worked relentlessly.\n",
      "His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city.\n",
      "The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees.\n",
      "When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion, he sought to convince another National League club to move here.\n",
      "When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league, the Continental, with New York as the key franchise.\n",
      "The Continental League never got off the ground, but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand.\n",

      "And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share.\n",
      "Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation, all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold( 185,000 to the public at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share).\n",
      "There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering.\n",
      "After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.\n",
      "But the result of it all was, E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes, an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation.\n",
      "He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do.\n",
      "The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.\n",
      "As a result, it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend).\n",
      "Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months, both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at, and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up.\n",

      "Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives, men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.\n",
      "But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms.\n",
      "So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito.\n",
      "All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.\n",
      "Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known as Chip-o's, turns out to sell as well as its stock did, the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to.\n",

      "-- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn'', Beryl W. Sprinkel, economist of Harris Trust& Savings Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn., California group, conference.\n",
      "Another speaker, William H. Draper, Jr., former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper, Gaither& Anderson, urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more''.\n",
      "Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan'' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern.\n",
      "`` In view of the current expansion, which promises to be substantial'' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months, but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960''.\n",
      "Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth, declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence''.\n",
      "Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth'', he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery''.\n",
      "He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation''.\n",
      "The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958''.\n",
      "The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion, he said, was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike.\n",
      "He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration, that `` Russia respects our show of strength, but that presently we're not acting as we should and must''.\n",
      "He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action, and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do''.\n",
      "While he declined to suggest, how, he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro, `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere.\n",
      "Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that''.\n",
      "Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level'' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average.\n",
      "It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages.\n",

      "However, Peterson, president of Bell& Howell, warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador, that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom''.\n",
      "`` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal, management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed'', Peterson said.\n",
      "The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past, but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs.\n",
      "Nothing to fear\n",
      "Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas.\n",
      "He cited, as an example, how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs, by improving its production know-how and technology.\n",

      "Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts.\n",
      "Starts were down 20 percent from 1959.\n",
      "The reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen, and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders''.\n",
      "Paradoxically, the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output.\n",
      "Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather, are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines.\n",
      "Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently.\n",
      "The higher price supports provided by the new legislation, together with rising prices for farm products, are pushing up farm income, making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.\n",

      "`` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground''.\n",
      "The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable.\n",
      "But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military, economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting.\n",
      "He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.\n",
      "He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned.\n",
      "But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.\n",

      "The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations''.\n",
      "The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East.\n",
      "That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David'' -- a spirit, it later turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement.\n",
      "The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda, the hope of one-sided concessions, and the chance to split the Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry.\n",
      "Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President, Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem.\n",
      "`` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way, no amount of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations''.\n",
      "The President had set for himself the task, which he believed vital, of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance.\n",
      "He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary.\n",
      "He wanted time, too, to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating.\n",
      "Above all, he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep.\n",
      "At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader.\n",
      "But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting, provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it.\n",
      "It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war, to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views.\n",
      "Moreover, an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.\n",
      "Both elements -- the caution about a meeting, the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February.\n",
      "The letter, dated Feb. 22, was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9.\n",
      "Developments over the next two months, however, caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing.\n",
      "In the U. S., strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing.\n",
      "Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown, or even continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.\n",
      "There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly to Communist China.\n",
      "The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent.\n",
      "Moreover, Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies, including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos.\n",
      "Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements, or even negotiations, impossible.\n",
      "Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting.\n",
      "At the same time, there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader, as a result of those episodes, come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure.\n",
      "U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized'' on Soviet terms.\n",
      "Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces.\n",
      "In the light of those events, there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself.\n",
      "Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.\n",
      "He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out.\n",
      "The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back.\n",
      "It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future.\n",
      "`` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries.\n",
      "The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations.\n",
      "But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.\n",
      "Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men.\n",
      "The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause.\n",
      "Apart from the personal equation, another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit.\n",
      "Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway.\n",
      "There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev, the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders.\n",
      "Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.\n",
      "There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world.\n",
      "If tests are to be resumed, the argument went, it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union.\n",
      "Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse.\n",
      "After Cuba and Laos, it was argued, Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds.\n",
      "The question was raised, for example, as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.\n",
      "There are, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.\n",
      "The shell, which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended to cancel out the possibility of future development.\n",
      "There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive: our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.\n",
      "The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades, rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.\n",
      "By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence.\n",
      "Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect, we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university.\n",
      "But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project;;\n",
      "certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy.\n",
      "American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning.\n",
      "They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made.\n",
      "All of this may be understandable enough: it is, however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise.\n",
      "Yet for better or for worse, the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative, resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities.\n",
      "To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education, it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community.\n",
      "The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.\n",
      "There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business''.\n",
      "It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot.\n",
      "For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions, which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools, it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence''.\n",
      "The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers'' are needed but that a different brand is called for.\n",
      "Commenting on the earlier stage, the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making) noted that the term `` teacher-employee''( as opposed to, e.g., `` maintenance employee'') was a not inapt description.\n",
      "Today however, the `` outsider'' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university.\n",
      "And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene, the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement.\n",
      "In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it: `` Even with the best of intentions he( the President of the university) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which, considered( as it must be by him) in individual terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying temperament, interests and capabilities.\n",
      "It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are, in their opinion, identified with its highest good and( to use that oft-repeated phrase)' the attainment of excellence'''.\n",
      "The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame: it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns'' it, becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside'' faculty.\n",
      "It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university'': this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension.\n",
      "But in any case, one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one.\n",
      "`` Outside'' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.\n",
      "There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university.\n",
      "Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession, much given to attending meetings and conferences.\n",
      "In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.\n",
      "To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security, that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service.\n",
      "Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure.\n",
      "A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family''.\n",
      "Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices, it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions.\n",
      "Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place.\n",
      "Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification.\n",
      "There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels.\n",
      "The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication, even informal debates over the luncheon table, are a contribution to the total good of the institution.\n",
      "But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.\n",
      "The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group'' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees, is, therefore, the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.\n",
      "This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure.\n",
      "Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control, there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order.\n",
      "Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions.\n",
      "Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work'' and ersatz decision making.\n",
      "In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all.\n",
      "In the Notre Dame report, reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication''.\n",
      "In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation'': the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy, i.e., members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution, have their own eating arrangements.\n",
      "Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws.\n",
      "Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws, there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions: the law must treat everybody equally.\n",
      "Or, in the words of Anatole France, `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich, as well as the poor, from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges''.\n",
      "The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and, later, into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites.\n",
      "The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program.\n",
      "In addition, disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill.\n",
      "It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages, but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike.\n",
      "Business Week( Aug. 9, 1961) reports that the United Aircraft Company, against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep its plants operating.\n",

      "they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.\n",
      "The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.\n",
      "The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete, but along completely undefined lines;;\n",
      "The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law.\n",
      "Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy.\n",
      "Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market.\n",
      "The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied.\n",
      "The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.\n",
      "Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price.\n",
      "Naturally, enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time.\n",
      "Under the circumstances, the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted.\n",
      "The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government, after the conviction, that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows.\n",
      "In other words, the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.\n",
      "Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas, throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence in the laws''??\n",
      "The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold, in The Folklore of Capitalism, back in 1937.\n",
      "He wrote: ``( P. 211) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations, and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure.\n",
      "( P. 214) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship.\n",
      "( P. 215) when corporate abuses were attacked, it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control.\n",
      "In this manner, every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws.\n",
      "( Pp. 228-229) in any event, it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known, held together by some of the most fantastic ideas, all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government''.\n",
      "This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while.\n",
      "A plea of nolo contendere, followed by a nominal fine, after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license.\n",
      "However, one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational.\n",
      "Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union.\n",
      "Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform.\n",
      "The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934, implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act, has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle.\n",
      "The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.\n",
      "If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn( unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural subsidy), then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them.\n",
      "Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America.\n",
      "As early as 1776, Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations: `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work;;\n",
      "but many against combining to raise it''.\n",
      "In 1825, the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers, who declared: `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies''.\n",
      "`` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject, the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it;;\n",
      "but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means''.\n",
      "Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin, according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19, 1961, defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages, production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment''.\n",
      "Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation.\n",
      "His bill, allegedly aimed at Hoffa, would amend the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international.\n",
      "Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation, the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.\n",
      "Indeed, it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws;;\n",
      "for example, the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers.\n",
      "At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates.\n",
      "In the famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices, e.g., trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer.\n",
      "The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.\n",
      "In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity.\n",
      "The company sued under the anti-trust laws, alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce.\n",
      "( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise??\n",
      ") The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce.\n",

      "Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery, Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand: within 48 hours, the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens, plus 120 Cuban employees).\n",
      "President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers, decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately.\n",
      "`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure'', said the President.\n",
      "Through Secretary Herter, Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision.\n",

      "But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration( see foreign news), and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos.\n",
      "There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts.\n",

      "At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China settled, the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state, North Viet Nam -- which then, predictably, became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos.\n",
      "The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement, saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West.\n",

      "As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week, liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor.\n",
      "And counting noses, they seemed to have the votes to work their will.\n",
      "There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock, or 2) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer( pronounced Calmer).\n",
      "Caucusing, the liberals decided to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.\n",
      "A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer looks younger than his 70 years, has gradually swung from a moderate, internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative.\n",
      "He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents.\n",
      "There his vote, along with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia judge, and the four Republican members, could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out, Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes).\n",
      "There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster: he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi.\n",
      "Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations, but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons.\n",
      ") But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective.\n",
      "In a tense, closed-door session with Judge Smith, Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add three new members to the Rules Committee( two Democrats, including one Southerner, and one Republican).\n",
      "Smith flatly rejected the offer, and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels.\n",
      "The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer, whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man''.\n",
      "He shouted, and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object: `` A dangerous precedent''!!\n",
      "Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.\n",
      "As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses, it became clear that Judge Smith could lose.\n",
      "His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus.\n",
      "( One big question: If Colmer was to be purged, what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors??\n",

      "Privately, they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon.\n",
      "In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding.\n",

      "One day last week, Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote, and then to make `` sufficient declaration'' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election.\n",

      "And that is just what happened on the last few holes.\n",
      "Player was the first to feel its teeth.\n",
      "After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's game rapidly fell to pieces.\n",
      "He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole, was leading him by a stroke.\n",
      "Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player, and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.\n",
      "Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf.\n",
      "When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship won.\n",
      "But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression.\n",
      "In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green, past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower.\n",
      "Afterwards, Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round partner, that he simply played the hole too fast.\n",
      "He did seem hasty on his second and third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure, which he had quite visibly lost.\n",
      "The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur, who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years, refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.\n",
      "As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69.\n",
      "His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score, a 213 by Bill Collins, the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long.\n",
      "But Palmer knew, as did everybody else at Augusta, that his streak was about to be broken.\n",
      "Half an hour after he finished his round, Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206, four strokes ahead of Palmer.\n",
      "Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes, the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.\n",
      "Unlike most such sports rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously, although this was not exactly the case.\n",
      "When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige.\n",
      "As if to confirm his stature, he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments.\n",
      "On the final round at Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and, although it was far from obvious at the time, the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.\n",
      "On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and, as it turned out, neither won it.\n",
      "He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71.\n",
      "When they reached Augusta last week, together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date.\n",
      "It was a dismal, drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course.\n",
      "The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences.\n",
      "Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob Rosburg.\n",
      "Even so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be, essentially, a match between Palmer and Player.\n",
      "or Ken Venturi, who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better;;\n",
      "Rosburg had started early in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated, as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend, by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a 73, was not having a good day.\n",
      "As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender.\n",
      "On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament.\n",
      "The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph.\n",
      "At one point late in the day, when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th, a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole.\n",
      "Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed( although he later admitted that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer, and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply.\n",
      "Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course.\n",
      "It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence.\n",
      "The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions.\n",
      "Bob Jones played that way.\n",
      "As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.\n",
      "As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day.\n",
      "Player immediately proceeded to follow suit.\n",
      "In fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well, to go 4 under par for the first eight holes.\n",
      "But Player's real test came on the ninth hole, a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.\n",
      "Having hit one of the trees, the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out.\n",
      "Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5, or gambling.\n",
      "The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse, hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.\n",
      "`` I was hitting the ball well'', Player said later, `` and I felt strong.\n",
      "When you're playing like that you'd better attack''.\n",
      "Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget.\n",
      "On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days.\n",
      "At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club, so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green.\n",
      "His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par.\n",
      "This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.\n",
      "It is the year when( 1) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs;;\n",
      "( 2) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game;;\n",
      "Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats, the shrinking strike zone, and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal.\n",
      "Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion.\n",
      "Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games.\n",
      "`` It has to be easier with two of them.\n",
      "How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle''??\n",
      "Although both concede they would like to hit 60, they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: `` The important thing is to win the pennant''.\n",
      "The sluggers get along so well in fact, that with their families at home for the summer( Mantle's in Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming together.\n",
      "They divide up the household chores: Cerv does most of the cooking( breakfast and sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies the transportation( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible), and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium.\n",
      "As roommates, teammates, and home-run mates, Mantle, 29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago, and Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds.\n",
      "as halfbacks, both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma( `` Sometimes in the minors'', Maris recalls, `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma'').\n",
      "With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders, both must have their clothes made to order.\n",
      "Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual, but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer''.\n",
      "Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips.\n",
      "Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or, for that matter, to private speaking.\n",
      "What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris, under constant pressure from writers and photographers, are trying to be cooperative.\n",
      "`` See that kid''??\n",
      "He said, pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy.\n",
      "I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real low, and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says:' You stunk'''.\n",
      "Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer all questions candidly and fully, but on rare occasions, he shuns newsmen.\n",

      "`` When I was a kid'', Maris told a sportswriter last week, `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score, just to see whether he got a hit or not''.\n",
      "`` When you came up to the majors, did you seek out Williams for advice''??\n",
      "`` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize''.\n",
      "`` When Mickey went to the Yankees'', says Mark Freeman, an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver, `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker, just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man, this hero of his.\n",

      "Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public( Time, Jan. 2), Thompson, at 61, is something of a legend in his own lifetime.\n",

      "Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings;;\n",
      "The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate.\n",
      "it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done, or failed to do, in the Congo since 1885.\n",
      "The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment.\n",
      "Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child, if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant.\n",

      "They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food.\n",
      "But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month, the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often.\n",
      "Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land, and trained many.\n",
      "It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together'', a grade at a time, until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history, economics and political science.\n",
      "Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it??\n",
      "In one large oversimplification, it might be said that the Belgians felt, far too late, the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa.\n",
      "They lacked time to prepare the Congo, as the British and French had prepared their colonies.\n",
      "It is hard to blame them for this.\n",
      "And fourth, there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up.\n",
      "A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo, immediately after independence, was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration.\n",
      "Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other, and to them independence meant an opportunity for war.\n",
      "The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government: there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.\n",
      "Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations.\n",
      "The Belgian government decided to act, and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo.\n",

      "Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians, and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them.\n",
      "Vague in wording, it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the( Congolese) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until, through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks.\n",
      "Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African, or at least nonwhite, nations -- certainly not from the U.S., Russia, Great Britain or France.\n",
      "It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo.\n",
      "The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts.\n",
      "The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help.\n",
      "( However, there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist.\n",
      "Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia, he first appealed to the U.S. for military help, and was rejected.\n",
      ") Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars'' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well.\n",
      "Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars'', dispatching `` technicians'' and even threatening, on occasion, to intervene openly.\n",
      "The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well, withdrawing all of their uniformed troops.\n",
      "But they left behind them large numbers of officers, variously called `` volunteers'' or `` mercenaries'', who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga, the seceded province which, according to Tshombe, holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country.\n",
      "From October 1960 to February 1961, the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action.\n",
      "There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters, and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation, whether to unify it, federalize it or Balkanize it.\n",
      "In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe, again stirred the U.N. to action.\n",
      "On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort''.\n",

      "To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems, Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend.\n",
      "The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham, who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support.\n",

      "From the luggage, they learned that the two air pirates, far from being Cubans, were native Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden, 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz., and his son, Cody, 16, a high-school junior.\n",

      "Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.\n",
      "Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds.\n",
      "Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard& Poor's average.\n",
      "You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page.\n",
      "Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent, or very close to that.\n",
      "And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to, or beyond, the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds.\n",
      "That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds.\n",
      "It's not much more, in fact, than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds.\n",
      "It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income.\n",
      "Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February, as compared with those same months in 1960.\n",
      "Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.\n",
      "Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do.\n",
      "In the 12 months ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves.\n",
      "Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.\n",
      "In these cases, the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases, or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways.\n",
      "Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes.\n",
      "Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28, 1961.\n",
      "Meanwhile, there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years.\n",
      "Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals.\n",
      "Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike.\n",
      "If nothing is done, the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962.\n",
      "It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full.\n",
      "Already, however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.\n",

      "The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines.\n",
      "The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years.\n",
      "Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to get on their feet.\n",
      "Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.\n",
      "At the same time, another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries.\n",
      "Japan, since 1957, has been `` voluntarily'' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S..\n",
      "Hong Kong, India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact''.\n",
      "The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market.\n",
      "Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly.\n",
      "The Kennedy hope is that, at the conference or through bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping'' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas.\n",
      "It's an important clue to Washington thinking.\n",
      "Note, too, that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry.\n",
      "In veiled terms, that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry.\n",
      "Rather, they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products.\n",

      "Every library borrower, or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically, `` I'm sorry, but we don't have that book.\n",
      "Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face, from the largest to the smallest.\n",
      "What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles??\n",
      "What to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction and nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified, when your budget is pitifully small??\n",
      "A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually, which includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city.\n",
      "Confronted with this situation, most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds.\n",
      "In some parts of the country, however, a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under the wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial help of the state, libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis.\n",
      "New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow.\n",
      "At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated area.\n",
      "At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System, in a high-density area, with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve.\n",
      "Both these types, and those in between, are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state.\n",
      "It was a step in the right direction, but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today.\n",
      "Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts.\n",
      "An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not, as they saw fit.\n",
      "A large, well-stocked library, surrounded in a county by smaller ones, may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great.\n",
      "A small library may cherish its independence and established ways, and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board.\n",
      "All services are given without cost to members.\n",
      "So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system, and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day, not too distant, when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op.\n",
      "Each system develops differently, according to the area it serves, but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency.\n",
      "The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served, and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if a library spends a certain number of dollars.\n",
      "In Nassau County, for example, the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City, the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons, a figure that has doubled since 1950.\n",
      "The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service, what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge, and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area.\n",
      "The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday needs, could afford.\n",
      "On microfilm, headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day, as well as bound volumes of important periodicals.\n",
      "The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.\n",
      "It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany, which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide.\n",
      "The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries.\n",
      "The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant, and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service.\n",
      "Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis.\n",
      "Local libraries find, too, that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system, and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library.\n",
      "The system passes on these savings to its members.\n",
      "Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary, art, and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs, and to organizations in member communities.\n",

      "The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.\n",

      "A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.\n",
      "The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year.\n",
      "Our comment was that this was `` featherbedding'' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement.\n",
      "The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.\n",
      "Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.\n",
      "The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries.\n",
      "The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands.\n",
      "Time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side.\n",

      "A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.\n",
      "While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.\n",
      "The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort.\n",
      "The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow.\n",

      "Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines.\n",
      "Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run.\n",

      "Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it, and there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.\n",
      "Mr. Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow, rhythmic motions, and then swung his feet up into it.\n",
      "Here, in the cool, autumn-touched evening, Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace.\n",

      "The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet.\n",
      "But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine, linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake.\n",
      "Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he had walked to it.\n",
      "And there, on the way, had been the box turtle, that slow, self-contained, world-ignoring relic of pre-history, bent, for reasons best known to itself, on crossing the road.\n",
      "It was doing very well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car.\n",
      "Would he take pains to avoid it??\n",
      "The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon.\n",
      "I do it, lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when it's all quiet.\n",
      "As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon, Mr. Podger saw that thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped that the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped quiet.\n",
      "She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly, and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe.\n",
      "Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out.\n",
      "`` It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire, and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice, scary one.\n",

      "The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation.\n",
      "Even better, they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.\n",
      "The Nashville plan, incidentally, has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South.\n",
      "Each year another grade is added to the process, until finally all 12 grades are integrated.\n",
      "The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done, `` so why not now''.\n",
      "The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston.\n",

      "Hotels, for example, are ready to let down the bars.\n",
      "It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South.\n",
      "Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights.\n",
      "They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots.\n",
      "All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it.\n",
      "Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.\n",
      "They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order.\n",
      "In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way.\n",
      "And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real sense of co-operation has sprung up.\n",
      "This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation.\n",
      "They realize that by acting in concert, rather than individually, they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise.\n",
      "Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship.\n",
      "Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane B, which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h..\n",
      "The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him.\n",
      "( 2) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;;\n",
      "or( 3) alternately accelerate and decelerate, thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair.\n",
      "The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access.\n",
      "In Chicago, the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back.\n",
      "This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways, however, does an injustice to Southern California drivers.\n",
      "At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company, I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype.\n",
      "After three months of research, I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered.\n",
      "During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street.\n",
      "An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year.\n",
      "This happened to be vice versa, but even so, the answer was a masterpiece.\n",
      "`` It's a whole lot easier'', he said, `` to increase the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the population of New York city''.\n",
      "And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher.\n",
      "This was just Richard's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.\n",
      "Some brilliant rookies nailed them down, so that this spring just two spots, left and right field, are really up for grabs.\n",
      "It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year, but so far it hasn't worked that way.\n",
      "You'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring, but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961.\n",
      "Obviously, if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League, it will have to show improvement someplace.\n",
      "Where can that improvement possibly come from??\n",
      "You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year.\n",
      "Brooks Robinson is great, and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960.\n",
      "If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint.\n",
      "They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.\n",
      "Hansen will be getting a late spring training start, which might very well set him back.\n",
      "He got off to an exceptional start last season, and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.\n",
      "There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year.\n",
      "They don't expect to stop him, just slow him down some with the bat.\n",
      "But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.\n",
      "So, all in all, the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first.\n",
      "`` They're the ones we can expect to do better''.\n",
      "The man is right, and at this time, indications are that these three are ready for better seasons.\n",
      "He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him.\n",
      "If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years, the club will have to be better off offensively.\n",
      "I'm still not convinced, though, I'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him.\n",
      "Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors, make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year, but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant.\n",
      "When he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant, and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club.\n",
      "He was down, hard to talk to, and far too nonchalant on the field.\n",
      "As of now, that all seems behind him.\n",
      "And Walker looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year.\n",
      "So, if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos and Walker will have to do it.\n",

      "It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs.\n",
      "With our current $3 per hundred tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant'' as the best way to meet these problems.\n",
      "In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure.\n",
      "Mr. Richard Preston, executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission, in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said: `` If this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach, success if any will be difficult to obtain''.\n",

      "If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic, the court has no jurisdiction.\n",
      "Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States, it also prevents us from using the court effectively.\n",

      "Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1, the US and UK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down.\n",
      "The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations.\n",
      "So, while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning, history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat.\n",
      "On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned the UN General Assembly that this country, in `` self protection'', might have to resume above-ground tests.\n",
      "More recently, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, `` admitted'' to a news conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the US might fall behind Russia( he apparently meant in weapons development) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain.\n",
      "All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.\n",
      "On the one hand, the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern'' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the Aj.\n",
      "But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations, and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States''.\n",
      "Then it added: `` It is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected''.\n",
      "Having hedged its bets in this way, PHS apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all: `` At present radiation levels, and even at somewhat higher levels, the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected''.\n",
      "Then, to conclude on an indeterminate note: `` Nevertheless, if fallout increased substantially, or remained high for a long time, it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world''.\n",
      "Dr. Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has been less ambiguous, whether you choose to agree with him or not.\n",
      "After declaring, in an article last month in Frontier Magazine, that the Russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world'', he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons:\n",
      "The damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects.\n",
      "Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.\n",
      "The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups, from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn.\n",
      "But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem.\n",
      "Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing.\n",
      "An illustration of this attitude is found in John A. McCone's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of The New Republic.\n",
      "If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout, it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.\n",
      "So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences, with the fission yield usually left vague.\n",
      "Now, of course, that the Russians are the nuclear villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid, when the US was testing in the atmosphere.\n",
      "The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout, if not exactly good for you, might not be much worse than a bad cold.\n",
      "After a nuclear blast, one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof.\n",
      "Things aren't that simple anymore.\n",
      "Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.\n",
      "As of October 25, the AEC had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton range, including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of TNT);;\n",
      "Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons, a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons.\n",
      "Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.\n",
      "If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests, the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion, meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far.\n",
      "To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November, 1958.\n",
      "One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas.\n",
      "When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late'50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices.\n",
      "It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.\n",
      "It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination.\n",
      "Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security.\n",
      "With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken.\n",
      "The third choice, negotiation, presupposes, as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.\n",
      "We take the position, however, that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us.\n",
      "Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice;;\n",
      "Leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice.\n",
      "For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing.\n",
      "Speaking recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests, we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests''.\n",
      "Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion, he argued that the responsibility of the United States is `` to do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular, but what is right''.\n",
      "What was missing in the Governor's argument, as in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right.\n",
      "The possibility, as he asserted, that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless, of course, we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand.\n",
      "Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary.\n",
      "Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the contrary, assured us that our lead is very great.\n",
      "Unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us, the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled'' to resume atmospheric testing.\n",
      "It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future, be necessary and even justifiable.\n",
      "What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations.\n",
      "We now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake.\n",
      "Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part.\n",
      "There ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does.\n",
      "The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start.\n",
      "With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom.\n",
      "Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective: each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy.\n",
      "First of all, it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity.\n",
      "Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light.\n",
      "Equally significant, Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity.\n",
      "A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity.\n",
      "Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church.\n",
      "The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as `` official'' observers reverses the Church's earlier stand.\n",
      "Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches.\n",
      "Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion, he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.\n",
      "For discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts, `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God, the irresistible efficacy of prayer, the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit''.\n",
      "Can any Christian fail to respond to these words??\n",
      "Certainly it isn't making the President happy, and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year.\n",
      "We sympathize with Mr. Kennedy, but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either, although for very different reasons.\n",
      "In the first place, a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor.\n",
      "The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.\n",
      "Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small, most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.\n",
      "And yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up'' and `` economizing''.\n",
      "We wish the President would remember that `` fiscal responsibility'' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.\n",
      "The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier.\n",
      "Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants, and when the speaker was a Catholic, one `` discussant'' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion.\n",
      "Sessions devoted to `` Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends'', `` Moral Principle and Political Judgment'', `` Christian Ethics in the Cold War'' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves.\n",
      "Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader.\n",
      "That Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants, but in the end the concept came to reassert itself.\n",
      "Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it, if, perhaps, by some other name.\n",
      "The impression was unmistakable that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence.\n",
      "Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself.\n",
      "It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own.\n",
      "But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed, and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues.\n",
      "One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts: knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical'' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin, for example;;\n",

      "The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful, orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved.\n",

      "Key to the puzzles\n",

      "The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth Congress of 1956, which ended with that famous `` secret'' report on Stalin.\n",
      "The publication last July of the party's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism'' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of ideas which had, in fact, been current over the last three or four years( i.e., since the defeat of the `` anti-party group'') in all theoretical party journals.\n",
      "These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes of Marx and Lenin `` full communism'' was still a very distant ideal, the establishment of a Communist society had now, under Khrushchev, become an `` immediate and tangible reality''.\n",
      "It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was, in fact, very largely a rehash of that interminable document).\n",
      "He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas, such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` All People's State'', and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization'' of the whole hierarchy of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.\n",
      "Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy'' and would enable `` the people'' to take a more direct and active part in running the country.\n",
      "there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from.\n",
      "Was it the party's intention, for example, to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes, i.e., state farms( which were, moreover, to be progressively `` urbanized'')??\n",
      "As we know, the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot;;\n",
      "and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes'' the peasants are finding it more profitable, to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm.\n",
      "If one follows the reports of the Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter.\n",
      "they still benefit far less than the `` other'' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state'' which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being.\n",
      "Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;;\n",
      "and, though he repeated, over and over again, the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980, the `` ordinary'' people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism'' is really going to work in practice, especially in respect of food.\n",
      "This was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts;;\n",
      "for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears'' of those responsible for agricultural production.\n",
      "One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group'' -- Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov.\n",
      "Molotov, in particular, is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services, to increase rents and fares;;\n",
      "The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story: what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin, Molotov had really proposed, we just don't know, and he has had no chance to reply.\n",
      "But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party'' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not, inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism'' and, last but not least, on foreign policy.\n",
      "`` Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment, and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war.\n",
      "The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev, together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov& Co., has shifted the whole attention of the world, including that of the Soviet people, from the `` epoch-making'' twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict.\n",
      "Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev's attack on Albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach'' to the problem( i.e., as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic''), but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev, calling him a liar, a bully, and so on.\n",
      "It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends.\n",
      "The big question is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa.\n",
      "Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence'' and would like, above all, the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully;;\n",
      "he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-American `` honeymoon'' of 1959.\n",
      "But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from China, but perhaps also from that `` China Lobby'' which, I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on the quiet inside the party.\n",
      "And the Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful'' peace with the West.\n",
      "The fact that China( which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter) should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative.\n",
      "And one cannot but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky, who was blowing hot and cold, exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet.\n",
      "And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb.\n",
      "Was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease'' the Chinese -- especially after `` Khrushchev's `` humiliating'' surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31??\n",
      "What does it all add up to??\n",
      "Indications are that Khrushchev( and, with him, the bulk of the Soviet people) favor peaceful coexistence and( with the exception of Berlin) the maintenance of the status quo in the world.\n",
      "The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans, on the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation'' they would like to embark on before long: with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries.\n",
      "He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition;;\n",
      "but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs, he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life.\n",
      "he may break with China( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous), or he may succeed, by all kinds of dangerous concessions, in persuading China to be patient.\n",
      "But to the Minutemen, this is a serious business.\n",
      "They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.\n",
      "They feel that World War 3, has already begun, and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense'' against the Communist advance.\n",
      "Their national leader, Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne, Mo., says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught.\n",
      "After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2, army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long, low ridge and a creek-filled gully.\n",
      "Here the two leaders, DePugh and Lauchli, hastened to put the group through its paces.\n",
      "They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge.\n",
      "There were no `` casualties'', but the `` guerrillas'' admitted to being `` a little tired'' when the leaders called a halt at 9 A.M. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.\n",
      "I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk( Dec. 16).\n",
      "It has to do with teachers' salaries and tenure.\n",
      "Next September, after receiving a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program, I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers.\n",
      "The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers.\n",
      "the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality.\n",
      "I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country, the profession is grossly overpaid.\n",
      "It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases;;\n",
      "there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance.\n",
      "The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them.\n",
      "The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure.\n",
      "Here, as in all sectors of the economy, quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.\n",
      "On the eve of the `` great debate'' on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community, we should face the alternatives on this proposition.\n",
      "What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate.\n",
      "Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others.\n",
      "It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs.\n",
      "I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common Market( Nov. 18) as a desirable organization for us to join.\n",
      "For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand.\n",
      "The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare'', or garden path, with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.\n",
      "The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal, as well as economic, self-rule.\n",
      "In entering this union we will be surrendering most, if not all, of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute( recently set up) or the O.E.C.D., I.M.F. and others.\n",
      "To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.\n",
      "If it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market, I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine section( Nov. 12, 1961), by Mr. Eric Johnston, entitled `` We Must Join The Common Market''.\n",
      "Referring to Britain, he says, `` We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy, placing this authority in Continental hands''.\n",
      "Since the goal of our international planners is a World Government, this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for, once American economic autonomy is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question of time.\n",
      "Listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say: `` Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.\n",
      "But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or `` economic empire'', but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years: an end to government regulations, an end to government competition in industry, and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry.\n",
      "In short, get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either.\n",
      "If we want to preserve our sovereignty, this is the way to do it;;\n",
      "not acquiesce to an international planning board.\n",
      "If we go into this Common Market, we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees, Connally Amendments or, for that matter, conservatism in general.\n",
      "The Peiping Chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on Monday morning, November 27, anticipating by two days the announcement of the U.S. Treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed.\n",
      "In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in any further Army Reserve activities.\n",
      "But, in spite of this, I, at present a man 31 years of age and a College Professor, have been recalled `` by direction of the President'' to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, for another twelve months of Active Duty as an Sp 4( the equivalent of a PFC).\n",
      "This time, added to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954, makes a total of twenty-two( 22) years of education.\n",
      "The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys.\n",
      "However, it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably, equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes''.\n",
      "In my own case, I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking.\n",
      "( A wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes.\n",
      ") At this late date, it is impossible for St. Michael's College to find a suitable replacement for me.\n",
      "Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- I cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.\n",
      "In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries.\n",

      "Truly, that Liberals should choose Louis 14, as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic, considering the Louis 14, character of their Grand Monarque, FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification,( le roi gouverne par lui meme), but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.\n",

      "It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' `` Don Quixote'' is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done in wide screen and color, which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses.\n",
      "Nikolai Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible, performs the lanky Don Quixote, and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.\n",
      "His addle-brained knight-errant, self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.\n",
      "Cherkasov does not caricature him, as some actors have been inclined to do.\n",
      "Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow, he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world.\n",
      "The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue.\n",
      "The voices of all the characters, including that of Cherkasov, have richness, roughness or color to conform with the personalities.\n",
      "The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island'' is one of the best in the film.\n",
      "True, the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half, before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court.\n",
      "There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange.\n",
      "Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz, which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family.\n",
      "There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time, for example, could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary.\n",
      "At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago And All That Jazz'', presented on NBC-TV Nov. 26.\n",
      "If so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents.\n",
      "A few years ago a `` Timex All-Star Jazz Show'' offered a broad range of styles, ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland.\n",
      "An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live'' character of the hour, and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.\n",
      "About that same time John Crosby's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do.\n",
      "The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music.\n",
      "One of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today.\n",
      "NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share.\n",
      "For example, there was sheet music with the word `` jazz'' in the title, to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold.\n",
      "However well chosen and cleverly arranged, such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business, which( considering the talent at hand) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style.\n",
      "Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke, but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse.\n",
      "By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists, the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either.\n",
      "Still, the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended, and future essays happily anticipated.\n",
      "Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad Scene'', but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment.\n",

      "There are 12 of these to choose from, all of them of popular music except for the star release, Pass In Review( SP-44001).\n",
      "Complete with crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes, and sundry other touches of realism, this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect.\n",
      "No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner, and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music.\n",
      "but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix, there is excellent depth and dimension to the music.\n",
      "London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels.\n",
      "In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.\n",
      "Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion'' or `` percussive''.\n",
      "Drums, xylophones, castanets, and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well.\n",
      "Only too often, however, you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right.\n",
      "They are definitely in the same room with you, but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley.\n",
      "The Percussive Twenties( SP-44006) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day, and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods( SP-44005).\n",
      "Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic, but not realistic.\n",
      "The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter.\n",
      "But, alas, the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge.\n",
      "The drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all.\n",
      "Thus, in `` The Story Of Ruth'' we have Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic.\n",
      "But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i.e., that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz -- the film version has little to do with the Bible.\n",
      "And in the new `` King Of Kings'' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels.\n",
      "Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow, director of the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.\n",
      "He intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War.\n",
      "And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity, he urged greater realism.\n",
      "Yet for much of the globe, Hollywood is just that -- prime, if not sole, source of knowledge.\n",
      "If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone, what conclusions do you think he might come to??\n",
      "The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists, so that for the first half of the program, when the piano was partially open, Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud.\n",
      "In vying with him, Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone.\n",
      "This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances, however, except in the case of the opening work, Mozart's Sonata in A( K. 526), which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion.\n",
      "Brahm's Sonata in A, although also vigorous, stood up well under the two artists' strong, large-scale treatment.\n",
      "The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer, who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada.\n",
      "They might well indicate conjugal felicity, but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.\n",
      "Works by Dohnanyi, Hubay, Mr. D'Albert himself and Paganini, indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase.\n",
      "Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard, and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control.\n",
      "The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century.\n",
      "It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best.\n",
      "The Rachmaninoff Prelude No. 12, Op. 32, for instance, gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.\n",
      "And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs.\n",
      "Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing.\n",
      "Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who, finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves, are more interested in men and their reactions to stress, hardship and danger''.\n",

      "Remaking an army to win\n",
      "But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command, of decisions and their reasons, of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action.\n",
      "Before he could return to Burma, Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits.\n",

      "If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position, we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves''.\n",
      "Brooding about future wars, the Field Marshal has this to say: `` The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave( as the white), usually more careless of death, less encumbered by mental doubts, less troubled by humanitarian sentiment, and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him.\n",
      "He is, by background and living standards, better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly, to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort, and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources''.\n",
      "A thoroughly ingratiating company it is, and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening.\n",
      "Not that it is all funny, by any means, though some of it is definitely so, but simply that the dancers are young and handsome, high-spirited and communicative, and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied.\n",
      "There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title, for it has a kind of nonstop format, and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification.\n",
      "But under the direction of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948, it has all been put into theatrical form, treated selectively, choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators, and performed altogether professionally.\n",
      "Since the organization was created thirteen years ago, it is obvious that this is not the original company;;\n",
      "it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company.\n",
      "indeed, there are never fewer than eight of them on stage, and that is only for the more intimate numbers.\n",
      "They can be exuberant or sentimental, flirtatious or funny, but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull.\n",
      "To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem, but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed.\n",
      "There is, for example, a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act;;\n",
      "the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera, `` Strasny Dwor', may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see;;\n",
      "The dialogue is sharp, witty and candid -- typical `` don't eat the daisies'' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays, and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it.\n",
      "The story is of a famous strip cartoonist, an arty individual, whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.\n",
      "This is when his troubles begin, not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires, and who turns out to have ideas of his own, with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.\n",
      "This may be unfortunate, perhaps, from the standpoint of David Hedison, Providence's contribution to Hollywood, who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox.\n",
      "Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role.\n",
      "But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist, and it has to be that way.\n",
      "It is a tremendous book, lively, constantly moving, and the Matunuck cast does well by it.\n",
      "This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards.\n",
      "They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.\n",
      "It is into this household, one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people, that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play.\n",
      "But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten.\n",
      "There is a fine second act, as an example, one in which Samuel Groom, as Dillon, has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another.\n",
      "This is an exciting young actor to watch.\n",
      "Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart, whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch.\n",

      "`` Where The Boys Are'' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy.\n",
      "The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux, but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers, just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases, I suppose this was the attitude the part called for.\n",
      "I must say, however, that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it.\n",
      "To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence, this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining.\n",
      "The second feature, `` The Price Of Silence'', is a British detective story that will talk your head off.\n",
      "Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking.\n",
      "For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series, under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger, Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius, not to mention the felicities of his style.\n",
      "His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant, forthright, and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child, and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor.\n",
      "Most of all, his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as `` that adorable genius''.\n",
      "Miss Hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship'', and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.\n",
      "This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought.\n",
      "It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual'' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues.\n",
      "To his Harvard colleague, Josiah Royce, whose philosophic position differed radically from his own, James could write, `` Different as our minds are, yours has nourished mine, as no other social influence ever has, and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly''.\n",
      "Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it, I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page''.\n",
      "Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- `` Glorious old Palmer'', as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce, Santayana, Palmer, and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions, ways of fronting life, and worth fighting for'', then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe.\n",
      "The world might ring with the struggle, if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other''.\n",
      "The `` belaboring'' is of course jocular, yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God.\n",
      "But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent: `` You ask what I am going to' reply' to Bradley.\n",
      "But why need one reply to everything and everybody??\n",
      "I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.\n",
      "As far as the rising generation goes, why not simply express ourselves positively, and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other.\n",
      "The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings, akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall, is equally well known.\n",
      "About all that remains to be said is that the present selection, most of which appeared first in The New Yorker, comprises( as usual) a slightly unstrung necklace, held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book.\n",
      "It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs, the hospitalized, and others forced to rely on inner resources, including( in the P's alone) `` palindromes'', `` paraphrases'', and `` parodies''.\n",
      "`` The Tyranny Of Trivia'' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber.\n",
      "`` How The Kooks Crumble'' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV commercials, and `` The Watchers Of The Night'' is a veritable waking nightmare.\n",
      "James, he remarks in a letter to a friend, `` is attempting the impossible namely, to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous impressions.\n",
      "He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once, and get all at once, the various shadings and complexities''.\n",
      "Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation: `` So much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it''.\n",
      "Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences??\n",
      "A tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes'' seems terribly funny, though it would be hard to explain why.\n",
      "' Thank God for that', I said;;\n",
      "In a sense, perhaps, Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter( was it Salvador Dali??\n",
      "Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume) Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple, unaffected humanness.\n",
      "In his concluding paragraph he writes: `` The devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can''.\n",
      "It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key.\n",
      "But this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion.\n",
      "The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler.\n",
      "And the leading issue, that of piecemeal aggression, remains the same.\n",
      "that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element.\n",
      "Now we have stood up to the Communists;;\n",
      "we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights.\n",
      "It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now.\n",
      "He writes, `` Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime''.\n",
      "He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man.\n",
      "Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently, so there is no fire in his eye.\n",
      "Stalin's death, Churchill's farewell to public life, Hillary and Tensing on Everest, Quemoy and Matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.\n",
      "Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles.\n",
      "Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections??\n",
      "And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all.\n",
      "A gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man, city slicker, lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community.\n",
      "( The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others.\n",
      ") They train the mink and other animals to fight.\n",
      "And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won't have anyone around that's against him, and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.\n",
      "Robert Hillyer, the poet, writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series.\n",
      "He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes.\n",
      "But it's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables.\n",
      "George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2, is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.\n",
      "It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: Scrupulous scholarship, a fund of personal experience, a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.\n",
      "the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style, and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time.\n",
      "If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals, if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well, the record itself is not too encouraging.\n",
      "But he rejects, perhaps a little too sweepingly, the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February, 1945.\n",
      "After all, Alger Hiss, subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents, was at Yalta.\n",
      "And Harry Dexter White, implicated in F.B.I. reports in Communist associations, was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan, which had it ever been put into full operation, would have simply handed Germany to Stalin.\n",
      "One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors, among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength.\n",
      "It is quite probable, however, that stupidity, inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender'' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism.\n",
      "`` You see, first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills, the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender: The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo, but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil, with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power, no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future''.\n",
      "Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler, he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground, which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944.\n",
      "A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language, history and literature, Kennan recalls how, at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, he penned a private note to a State Department official, expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries''.\n",
      "With justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement, about the history of its diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States''.\n",
      "He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's `` puerile'' assumption that `` if only he( Stalin) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R. himself, ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged''.\n",
      "No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days'' of Roosevelt.\n",
      "They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting.\n",
      "They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue.\n",
      "This, more than any other factor, led to the fiasco of Allied intervention.\n",
      "Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style, the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected.\n",
      "a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love, without mercy or pity;;\n",
      "a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment;;\n",
      "a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime.\n",
      "`` Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead, behind the tirades and the sulky silences, the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare, behind the prejudices, the cynicism, the total amorality of behavior, behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes, there lay a statesman of no mean qualities: Shrewd, calculating, in many ways realistic, endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation, capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired, yet bold and resolute in his decisions, and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess: The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word''.\n",
      "And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world, one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.\n",
      "Mr. Kennan, who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia, is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.\n",
      "There is plenty of violence, to be sure, but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed.\n",
      "By and large, Robert McEnroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film, `` The Quiet Man'', provides the entertainment it set out to, and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one.\n",
      "This is the tale of one John Enright, an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man.\n",
      "You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother, and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means.\n",
      "Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs, torso and neck, except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.\n",
      "His matchmaking is, naturally, incidental, and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.\n",
      "Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique, that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have, anyway.\n",
      "Joan Fagan, a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not, plays Ellen, and sings the role very well, too.\n",
      "she fits into the general scheme well enough.\n",
      "Susan Johnson, as the widow, spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one.\n",
      "She has a good, firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening.\n",
      "Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters, but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining.\n",
      "And in the role of Will Danaher, Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army, if he chose.\n",
      "It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain, and some of it, such as the catchy `` Sez I'', does.\n",
      "So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction.\n",
      "Rouben Ter-Arutunian, in his stage settings, often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.\n",
      "Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or not, you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.\n",
      "They faced a rather small audience, as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon.\n",
      "The Franck symphonic poem, `` Psyche'', is a lush, sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again.\n",
      "Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score.\n",
      "Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold, sweeping and tonally percussive.\n",
      "An impressive technician, Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm, to boot.\n",
      "it tends to be hard and colorless.\n",
      "A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs.\n",
      "But granted all this, one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied.\n",
      "This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry.\n",
      "And so, of course, it is a fan's opera as well.\n",
      "So the plot creaks, the sets are decaying, the costumes are pre-historic, the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing.\n",
      "After all, the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed, with no less than six leading parts.\n",
      "One of those parts is that of evil, evil Barnaba, the spy.\n",
      "What was lacking was a real sense of phrase, the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is, after all, a very oily character.\n",
      "Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast, but only with respect to this season;;\n",
      "Eileen Farrell in the title role, Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season, and all contributed to a vigorous performance.\n",
      "It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French `` chansons''.\n",
      "The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else.\n",
      "The original impulses came to England late( in the sixteenth century) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo, sonatas, operas and the like.\n",
      "The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way, say, the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal.\n",
      "Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England, much ahead of similar revivals in other countries.\n",
      "There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing, with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.\n",
      "Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong, lively, intense, controlled and quite abstract.\n",
      "Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote, not in the later sense of `` program music'' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close, clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.\n",
      "The Concerts -- nos. 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense.\n",
      "What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo.\n",
      "The Couperin `` La Steinkerque'', with its battle music, brevity, wit and refined simplicity, already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era.\n",
      "Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor, recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet( BAM LD 046), turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.\n",
      "Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Rosenmueller and Telemann, well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket( BAM LD 035).\n",
      "Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all, it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez.\n",
      "This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles.\n",
      "Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical, rationalist tradition,( handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music) becomes virtually neo-classicism.\n",
      "The simple, clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes.\n",
      "the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano.\n",
      "Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.\n",
      "It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera, `` The Poor Sailor'', set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea, a sailor returns, unrecognized, and gets done in by his wife.\n",
      "She had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m., the appointed hour, although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3.\n",
      "Along about 4:30, just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side, Judy came on singing, in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind.\n",
      "Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing.\n",
      "In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range.\n",
      "There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` Do It Again'', and she made the tart observation that `` I never saw so much moving about in an audience''.\n",
      "But it didn't take Judy Garland, showman, long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it.\n",
      "Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music, trundling microphones about the stage, helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere.\n",
      "To her partisan audience, such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise;;\n",
      "The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard `` Over The Rainbow'' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` Get Happy'' had to go home unhappy, about that item anyway.\n",
      "All went home happy except the Newport police, who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh, and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar.\n",
      "For subtle swinging rhythms, I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of `` Weep'', and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 Carrots For Robert'', a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges.\n",
      "There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein.\n",
      "He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.\n",
      "After the spate of female vocalists we have been having, all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat, it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever.\n",
      "it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear, and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience.\n",
      "The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship, not only in their own chosen set, but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns& Leon James, the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years, gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program.\n",
      "From this taste of the 1920s, we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz, which did lovely, subtle things for `` Baubles, Bangles And Beads'', and a couple of ballards.\n",
      "Getz is a difficult musician to categorize.\n",
      "In this he is sticking with tradition, however far removed from it he may seem to be.\n",
      "George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group, a sextet consisting of vibes, guitar, bass, drums, Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer.\n",
      "He met with enthusiastic audience approval, especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo.\n",
      "Shearing, himself, seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances.\n",
      "A very casual, pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies, hot sun, and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.\n",
      "Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies, he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches.\n",
      "One of those delightful surprise additions, which so frequently occur in jazz programs, was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones, drumming to `` Old Man River'', which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.\n",
      "It all went very well.\n",
      "Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas.\n",
      "Do you say chantey, as if the word were derived from the French word chanter, to sing, or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin, which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier, with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard??\n",
      "`` Signal'' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais.\n",
      "Here, as in `` Journal'', Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing, and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements.\n",
      "But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative, and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.\n",
      "One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect, there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.\n",
      "It may be, of course, that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation.\n",
      "But it may be, also, that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time.\n",
      "One thing is certain, however, and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents, phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be.\n",
      "Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin, the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' `` Once Upon A Time'' as well as her `` Women's Song'' and Mr. Nagrin's `` Indeterminate Figure''.\n",
      "But we need not mind too much, because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way.\n",
      "Miss Tamiris' `` Once Upon A Time'' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures'' that bother them somehow.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so.\n",
      "All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured, and the sizable company, with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers, seemed to be fine shape.\n",
      "The Symphony Of The Air, greatly assisted by Van Cliburn, last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start.\n",
      "At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie, and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs, repeating each of them in five different communities.\n",
      "They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony.\n",
      "This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains.\n",
      "The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky, the Rachmaninoff Third, and the Prokofieff Third.\n",
      "It was pleasant last night, therefore, to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded, `` The Emperor''.\n",
      "The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone, so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.\n",
      "The elements that did were the introspective slow movement, the beautiful transition to the third movement, and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.\n",
      "Alfred Wallenstein, the conductor, sensitive accompanist that he is, picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding, poetic mystery.\n",
      "And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance, the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical, yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven.\n",
      "There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in.\n",
      "Today, in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show, it is understandable that a song, no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms, is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it.\n",
      "In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit.\n",
      "Like the Gershwins, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them.\n",
      "If one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure, Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show.\n",
      "Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney, along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory, in a delightfully refreshing album, Rodgers And Hart Revisited( Spruce Records, 505 Fifth Avenue, New York).\n",
      "Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` The Garrick Gaieties'', an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed;;\n",
      "and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of `` I Blush'', a song that was cut from `` A Connecticut Yankee''.\n",
      "Turning to the current musical season on Broadway, the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, has been transferred to an original cast album( R. C. A. Victor LOC 1066;;\n",

      "For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel, Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles.\n",
      "There are the full-bodied, resourceful voices of Robert Weede, Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and, for an occasional change of pace, the bright humor of Molly Picon.\n",
      "Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms.\n",
      "Not content to create only the music and lyrics, Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away( Capitol WAO 1643;;\n",
      "stereo SWAO 1643), a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works.\n",
      "With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2, -- `` The House I Live In'', `` The Cranes Are Flying'' and `` Ballad Of A Soldier'' -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in `` The Day The War Ended''.\n",

      "Not that the picture is superficial.\n",
      "Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience.\n",
      "`` Ring Of Bright Water'' by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting, warmly personal chronicle of a man, an otter, and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands.\n",
      "`` He has married me with a ring of bright water'', begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title, and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys.\n",
      "How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna, his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift, the subtle changes in season over ten years, is a moving experience.\n",
      "There is Mijbil, an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat.\n",
      "It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature.\n",
      "This is not only a compliment to Mijbil, of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book, but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London, then by train( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap) to Camusfearna, with affectionate detail.\n",
      "Mij, as his owner was soon to learn, had strange, inexplicable habits.\n",
      "He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth.\n"

      "With curiosity and elan, he explored every inch of glen, beach and burn, once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell, who nearly lost his life in doing so.\n",
      "A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader, one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted, but self-discovery as well.\n",
      "Now, with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need, that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.\n",

      "They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats, as accurately as possible, the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century.\n",
      "Of course, the well-received revivals last longer than the others, and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism.\n",
      "The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who, in two instances this season, closed their plays after one performance.\n",
      "But they are aware of the world outside, they court public approval, they delight in full houses, and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic.\n",
      "In France, novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted.\n",
      "Last season, the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief, and, in consequence, we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's `` Phedre'' and Moliere's `` School For Wives''.\n",
      "perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time.\n",
      "The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately, possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance.\n",
      "A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama, but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.\n",
      "The new `` School For Wives'' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.\n",
      "Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago, Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns, while Fernand Ledoux, often performing at the Comedie, made them more gross than Moliere may have intended.\n",

      "No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far, it too could give a circus if it pleased.\n",
      "At the end of the program, indeed, there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes, and nothing could stop it.\n",
      "Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number, `` Taras Bulba'', but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all.\n",
      "But for all the manifest intention to `` show off'', this was a circus with a difference, for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level, it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.\n",
      "The `` Taras Bulba'' excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi.\n",
      "It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women, and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy, gregarious cavorting, and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform.\n",
      "The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty, as well as loveliness, and adagio is the general medium of the piece.\n",
      "Sergei Vikulov, as the lone male, meets the competition well with some brilliant hits, but the work is designed to belong to the ladies.\n",

      "And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational.\n",
      "He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls: five Democrats -- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Senator Stuart Symington, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy -- and two Republicans -- Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon.\n",
      "He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth, from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself;;\n",

      "Mr. Kennedy, Mr. White believes, `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him''.\n",
      "Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance.\n",

      "Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President.\n",
      "Throughout `` The Making Of A President'' Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates, how decisions have constantly to be made, how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down, how subordinates play key roles.\n",
      "`` The root question in American politics is always: Who's the Man to See??\n",
      "To understand American politics is, simply, to know people, to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes, who are straw men, who controls, who does not.\n",
      "But to operate in American politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names, establish a warmth, a personal connection''.\n",
      "`` In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion''.\n",
      "`` All platforms are meaningless: the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it''.\n",
      "Miss Pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments.\n",
      "The better part of gallantry might be, perhaps, to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown, and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing.\n",
      "No orchestra, however, could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night.\n",
      "One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's `` Shadow Song''.\n",
      "On the whole, however, one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.\n",
      "Mr. Verreau began shakily, with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume.\n",
      "Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener.\n",
      "Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which, in the United States, comprises some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year.\n",
      "He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials.\n",
      "It is estimated that more than 600 stations( of a total of 3,400) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro.\n",
      "At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states.\n",
      "Advertisers are changing their attitudes, both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it.\n",
      "Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational, economic, and cultural levels.\n",
      "In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent, and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent, according to a research man quoted by Sponsor.\n",
      "A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business.\n",
      "It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed: that more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states.\n",
      "And WWRL's colorful mobile unit, cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods, is a frequent reminder of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.\n",
      "Whatever the long-range impact of integration, the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal.\n",
      "Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.\n",
      "Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race;;\n",
      "he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous''.\n",
      "`` Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today, because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions, achievements and desires.\n",
      "It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro, seeking to become urbanized, as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life.\n",
      "Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow, Helen Farr Sloan, to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work.\n",
      "From early family portraits, painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year( 1951) and still part of his estate.\n",
      "As early as 1928, however, the Sloan style began to change.\n",
      "The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes.\n",
      "In addition to the paintings are drawings, prints, and illustrations.\n",
      "Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York, thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs.\n",
      "The fact that Sloan was an extrovert, concerned primarily with what he saw, adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle.\n",
      "There are 151 items in the Wilmington show, including one painting by each member of the `` Eight'', as well as work by Sloan's friends and students.\n",
      "All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan, who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League, New York, in the 1920's.\n",
      "To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries, the Delaware Art Center( according to its director, Bruce St. John) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works, as well as a card index file.\n",
      "The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians.\n",
      "Any musician playing Beethoven here, where Beethoven was born, is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care.\n",
      "The 32 C Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another, leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.\n",
      "The D Minor Sonata, Op. 31 No. 2, introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios, was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come.\n",
      "These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style'' of which Beethoven was genuinely capable, but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.\n",
      "He might have been hoping, to all appearances, that this relatively sunny symphony, in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program, could amount to something like the Ninth;;\n",
      "The concerto's soloist, Hans Richter-Haaser, played with compensatory ease and economy, though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling.\n",
      "Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano, Chorus, And Orchestra In C Minor, made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs.\n",
      "The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein( Bonn's civic chorus) was worth all the waiting, however, as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.\n",
      "The last program of this festival, which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories, brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis.\n",
      "But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.\n",
      "It is the business of cosmologists, the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe, to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors.\n",
      "These keys are the working principles of physics, mathematics and astronomy, principles which are then extrapolated, or projected, to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge.\n",
      "The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called, `` Rival Theories Of Cosmology''.\n",
      "First of all, and this has been calculated by observation, the universe is expanding -- that is, the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds.\n",
      "Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there.\n",
      "Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts, that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in.\n",
      "Then, after many more billions of years, when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center, this movement will slow down and reverse itself again.\n",
      "He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space.\n",
      "New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.\n",
      "For new galaxies to be created, Professor Bondi declares, it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years.\n",
      "Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons.\n",
      "The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite, but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure.\n",
      "Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms, it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere.\n",
      "This slim book, while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe, has the appeal that informed conversation always has.\n",
      "Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion, and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field.\n",
      "It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science.\n",
      "These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories.\n",
      "There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us, giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions.\n",
      "Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York, most of `` Roots'' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy.\n",
      "Only in its final scene, where Beatie Bryant( Mary Doyle) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts.\n",
      "The burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil( at least in England) are not the happy, fine, strong, natural, earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine.\n",
      "Rather they are genuine clods, proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought.\n",
      "Seeming to have roots in the soil, they actually have none in life.\n",
      "They dwell, in short, in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived.\n",
      "But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it.\n",
      "She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie( we never do see him) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating, including a dose of good British socialism.\n",
      "But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her, Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress, and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull, he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal.\n",
      "Beatie, getting no sympathy for her misfortune, soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom.\n",
      "But I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences.\n",
      "Shakespeare had a word for everything, even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's `` Much Ado About Nothing'' opening the season of free theatre in Central Park.\n",
      "The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick, so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult, raised chuckles.\n",
      "The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges, also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads, evoked laughter.\n",
      "As `` Much Ado'' turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar, a sprinkle began to fall.\n",

      "A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes.\n",
      "Some remained in the Wollman enclosure, fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads.\n",
      "In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare, like a Nostradamus, had foreseen this moment.\n",
      "The heavens refused to give up their weeping.\n",
      "One could hardly blame Newbold Morris, the Parks Commissioner, for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms, its balcony, its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains.\n",
      "Eldon Elder, who designed the stage, also created a gay, spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood.\n",
      "Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace, although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable.\n",
      "Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints.\n",
      "If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be, it is still a beautiful instrument, controlled and flexible.\n",
      "Put to the service of lieder of Schubert, Brahms, Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way, it made its effect with ease and precision.\n",
      "Instead of her old confidence in the simplest, purest, most moving musical expression, Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra, some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside.\n",
      "The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness.\n",
      "Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.\n",
      "On Saturday, the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field, the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing, and the order of the program improved.\n",
      "Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn, who danced the `` Nutcracker'' pas de deux, were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from `` Don Quixote'', another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.\n",
      "Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening, Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` The Duel'', a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.\n",
      "Mr. Ailey's `` Roots Of The Blues'', an earthy and very human modern dance work, provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening.\n",
      "As Brother John Sellers sang five `` blues'' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard, Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating, threatening, contemptuous and ecstatic.\n",
      "The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps, lifts, crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong, sometimes almost frightening, tensions.\n",
      "`` Perhaps it is better to stay at home.\n",
      "Mr. Sansom is English, bearded, formidably cultivated, the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories, of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between.\n",
      "The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning, his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell, Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty( her third) and an American multimillionaire( his fourth).\n",
      "The result is rather wonderful, but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices.\n",
      "All are well written and are overwritten.\n",
      "But, even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow, he still can charm and astound.\n",
      "`` I like to sniff a place, and reproduce what it really smells and looks like, its color, its particular kind of life''.\n",
      "It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for, an impression compounded of visual details, of a savory mixture of smells, of much loving attention to architecture and scenery, of lights and shadows, of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past.\n",
      "But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions.\n",
      "To transmit that feeling he writes''.\n",
      "So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez;;\n",
      "at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands, always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City;;\n",
      "at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants, La Bonne Auberge, which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport;;\n",
      "Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls( to those who recall easily) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto.\n",
      "In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza.\n",
      "How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus:\n",
      "`` The white colonnaded, cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South, the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza: the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch, the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen, his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep, his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips''.\n",
      "WBAI, the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band, has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void.\n",
      "WBAI is on the right track: in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre, as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate.\n",
      "Unfortunately, `` Poised For Violence'' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point.\n",
      "Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall -- and, in addition, employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged.\n",
      "The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves.\n",
      "But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt.\n",
      "Moreover, her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.\n",
      "But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words.\n",
      "good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration.\n",
      "A weekly showcase for contemporary music, from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music, is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.\n",
      "Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer, a particular type of music or the music of a given country.\n",
      "It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene.\n",
      "But one wishes, when the appetite is whetted, as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera, that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.\n",
      "The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close.\n",
      "It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season, but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart.\n",
      "It is good to see those numbers again.\n",
      "The `` Suite Of Old Russian Dances'' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth;;\n",
      "and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` City Quadrille'' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been, and they are welcome back.\n",
      "So, for that matter, are the newer dances -- the `` Kalmuk Dance'' with its animal movements, that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called `` The Platter'', the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` Summer'', `` The Three Shepherds'' of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs, and, of course, the trenchant `` Rock'n' Roll''.\n",
      "Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson, gold, purple, bronze, blue and vermilion that flame up in North America.\n",
      "Below is a specific guide, keyed to the calendar.\n",
      "Ontario's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10, with both Muskoka( 100 miles north of Toronto) and Haliburton( 125 miles northwest of Toronto) holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23.\n",
      "Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15, and often hit a height in early October.\n",
      "The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine.\n",
      "The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October, choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area.\n",
      "New Jersey's color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May.\n",
      "During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia.\n",
      "Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October, especially in their northern sections, e.g., Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29-Oct. 8.\n",
      "In Wisconsin, take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie Du Chien.\n",
      "In Michigan, there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits, while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular.\n",
      "In Minnesota, Arrowhead County and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding.\n",
      "Farther south, there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks, with some seasonal peaks as late as early November.\n",
      "Since 1892 ears of red, yellow, purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create huge `` paintings''.\n",
      "Every Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display, with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up to 130 feet.\n",
      "The gardens themselves are open free of charge the year round, and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor.\n",
      "Carson McCullers, after a long, painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul, has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication.\n",
      "Though the subject -- segregation in her native South -- has been thoroughly worked, Miss McCullers uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern American writing.\n",
      "With an art that almost conceals art, J. D. Salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts.\n",
      "A deft, hilarious satire on very high French society involving a statesman with two enviable possessions, a lovely young bride and a head containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove it for greater comfort.\n",
      "Two noted troupes from overseas will get the fall dance season off to a sparkling start.\n",
      "The Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company, with music and dances that depict the many facets of Filipino culture, opens its 60-city U.S. tour in San Francisco( through Sept. 24) then, via one-night stands, moves on to Los Angeles( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1).\n",
      "With harvests in full swing, you can enjoy festivals for grapes at Sonoma, Calif.( Sept. 22-24), as well as for cranberries at Bandon, Ore.( Sept. 28 thru Oct. 1), for buckwheat at Kingwood, W. Va.( Sept. 28-30), sugar cane at New Iberia, La.( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1) and tobacco at Richmond, Va.( Sept. 23-30).\n",
      "This French film, set in Italy, is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny scenery -- so breath-taking that at times you almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with.\n",
      "But slowly they take over as Alain Delon( Life, Sept. 15), playing a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy, casually tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going to murder him, then does it even while the American is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit from the act.\n",
      "Callas devotees will have good reason to do their customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo version of the Bellini opera.\n",
      "Of the nation's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below America's belt line.\n",
      "Waterways are busy right now from the Virginia capes to the Texas coast.\n",
      "And on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens of frostbite races.\n",
      "Inland, outboard motorists welcome cooler weather and the chance to buzz over Colorado River sandbars and Lake Mead.\n",
      "But regattas are scheduled right up to Christmas.\n",
      "Hurricane Carla damaged 70% of the marinas in the Galveston-Port Aransas area but fuel service is back to normal, and explorers can roam as far west as Port Isabel on the Mexican border.\n",
      "Sailing activity is slowed down by Texas northers, but power cruisers can move freely, poking into the San Jacinto, Trinity and Brazos rivers( fine tarpon fishing in the Brazos) or pushing eastward to the pirate country of Barataria.\n",
      "The Mississippi Sound leads into a protected waterway running about 200 miles from Pascagoula to Apalachicola.\n",
      "Ten thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the 30-odd lakes in the vast Tennessee River system that loops in and out of seven states.\n",
      "A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago, the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957.\n",
      "Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites'' resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver, whereas Portago was a good one.\n",
      "One looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing, as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised.\n",
      "Unhappily, `` Heaven Has No Favorites'' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list.\n",
      "His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery, years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium, being higher than she wishes to pay.\n",
      "Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement, Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse, some demure and rather fetching love-making, pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe, and a modicum of automobile racing.\n",
      "the love-making, perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness, is often charming;;\n",
      "the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.\n",
      "Hazards to life and limb on the golf course, while existent, are actuarially insignificant.\n",
      "Race-drivers, on the other hand, are quite often killed on the circuit, and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm, one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes.\n",
      "The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing.\n",
      "The necessity is not clear to me, and, in any case, to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car, which, or whom, he calls `` Giuseppe'', parked `` on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him'' is not a liberty;;\n",
      "But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death, which is the primary concern of the book, that Remarque's failure is plainest.\n",
      "To be human, he believes, is to seek one's own destruction: the Freudian `` death-wish'' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers.\n",
      "a Portago could say, as he did say to me, `` If I die tomorrow, still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years;;\n",
      "I'll live to be 105''.\n",
      "The Italian master Piero Taruffi, no less sensitive, knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae.\n",
      "Clerfayt, driving, sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell'';;\n",
      "the Briton Stirling Moss, one of the greatest virtuosi of all time, believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet.\n",
      "Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us.\n",
      "However, my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers, pilots, submariners, atomic researchers, and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.\n",
      "The west is leaderless, according to this book.\n",
      "Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all.\n",
      "It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity;;\n",
      "about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable, and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy.\n",
      "If, say, the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub, then Tom Jones would fight the Commies.\n",
      "Never given to mincing words, he places heavy blame upon the faulty, uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America.\n",
      "At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state.\n",
      "With Britain looking inward, overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States.\n",
      "Montgomery believes that she started well.\n",
      "`` America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike''.\n",
      "She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity, but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.\n",
      "The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars, and that she compulsively strives to be liked.\n",
      "However, she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed.\n",
      "But the greater reason for fumbling, stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor.\n",
      "`` They are determined'', Montgomery writes, `` not to be surprised again, and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary, but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible''.\n",
      "The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad.\n",
      "To `` Monty'', the American people, who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight, `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War''.\n",
      "As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead.\n",
      "The path to leadership is made clear.\n",
      "Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group, a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence.\n",
      "This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States, namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany, that the East German government does not exist, that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired, that the true government of China is in Formosa, that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960, and that either China or Russia wants or expects war.\n",
      "Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically, and establish that true unity about which it has always talked.\n",
      "After drastically overhauling NATO, Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West.\n",
      "Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories, say by 1970.\n",
      "but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out''.\n",
      "Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy.\n",
      "He alone has the wisdom, the conviction, the tenacity, and the courage to reach a decision.\n",
      "Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership.\n",
      "The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself, lead a carefully regulated and orderly life, allow time for quiet thought and reflection, adapt decisions and plans to changing situations, be ruthless, particularly with inefficiency, and be honest and morally proper.\n",
      "All in all, Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.\n",
      "In looking as far back as Moses, thence to Cromwell, Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, and Nehru, Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men.\n",
      "He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill, who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war.\n",
      "However, Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice.\n",
      "Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said, and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene.\n",
      "For the most part, his writing rambles and jogs, preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts.\n",
      "And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events.\n",
      "It is no common thing for a listener( critical or otherwise) to hear a singer `` live'' for the first time only after he has died.\n",
      "But then, Mario Lanza was no common singer, and his whole career, public and non-public, was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital'' only when he has ceased to be a living voice.\n",
      "It is a kind of justice, too, that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall, where, traditionally, the loudest, if not the greatest, performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate( RCA Victor LM 2454, $4.98).\n",
      "To be sure, Lanza made numerous concert tours, here and abroad, but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk.\n"

      "The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person, which, allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night, means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day.\n",

      "Pursuing it, he has logged 500,000 miles, suffered indescribable digestive indignities, and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals, from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini.\n",
      "Keys's findings, though far from complete, are likely to smash many an eating cliche.\n",
      "Vitamins, eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on( though mothers' milk is still the ticket).\n",
      "Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood, which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks, are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram, which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack.\n",
      "With meat, milk, butter and ice cream, the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat, and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind, says Dr. Keys, that increases blood cholesterol, damages arteries, and leads to coronary disease.\n",
      "Throughout much of the world, food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.\n",
      "In West Africa, for example, where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals, a childhood menace is kwashiorkor, or `` Red Johnny'', a growth-stunting protein deficiency( signs: reddish hair, bloated belly) that kills more than half its victims, leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease.\n",
      "Says Keys: `` Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral, the fat man would start to think''.\n",
      "Morals aside, the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him.\n",
      "The simple mechanical strain of overweight, says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe, can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built''.\n",
      "The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums.\n",
      "He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes.\n",
      "The appestat, which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant, is located, says Jolliffe, in the hypothalamus -- near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance controls.\n",
      "It may be fostered by frustration, depression, insecurity -- or, in children, simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging.\n",
      "The result says Jolliffe: `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life''.\n",
      "It's a matter of boredom, and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something, because she's being deprived of something else''.\n",
      "For the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won.\n",
      "Keys has no such objections to Metrecal, Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters.\n",
      "But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.\n",
      "What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer: coronary artery disease, which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer, five times the deaths from automobile accidents.\n",
      "Scientists assume that cholesterol( from the Greek chole, meaning bile, and sterios, meaning solid) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells, since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight.\n",
      "They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones, and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system.\n",
      "`` A remarkable substance'', says Dr. Keys, `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries''.\n",
      "When thus deposited, Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks.\n",

      "Or( more commonly, thinks Keys) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated, cells supplied by the artery die, and the heart is permanently, perhaps fatally injured.\n",
      "Ordinarily, the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile.\n",
      "That year, Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods.\n",
      "That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell, timing oxidation rates of blood fats, stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically, while animal fats cause them to rise.\n",
      "Here Keys and others, such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute, took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each.\n",
      "As a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed.\n",
      "The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all.\n",
      "For in the modern world neither `` spirit'' nor `` matter'' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience.\n",
      "We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected.\n",
      "When the words are used, we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind, or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.\n",
      "Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true.\n",
      "In such a world the words `` matter'' and `` spirit'' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all.\n",
      "In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general, which now cause us much difficulty, could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously.\n",
      "The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it.\n",
      "Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time.\n",
      "When, therefore, it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit, these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality.\n",
      "The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means, or at best with wholly inadequate means, for dealing with his experience of spirit.\n",
      "Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever.\n",
      "There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality, as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which we can refer this experience.\n",
      "As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century.\n",
      "There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people.\n",
      "A teenage girl, Abigail Williams, is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle, the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings.\n",
      "The audience leaves the play under a spell, It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes.\n",
      "If one asks about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give than `` spirit''.\n",
      "This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience.\n",
      "In the end the good man, John Proctor, expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says, `` A fire, a fire is burning!!\n",
      "The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them.\n",
      "In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play.\n",
      "We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false.\n",
      "In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play, he says at one point: `` However, that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants.\n",
      "And his belief is not to his discredit.\n",
      "Better minds than Hale's were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken''.\n",
      "The concept of unity, in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas.\n",
      "When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state''.\n",
      "Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real.\n",
      "Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem.\n",
      "It casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power.\n",
      "It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect.\n",
      "For this does not account for the integral, elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds, nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell.\n",
      "The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary.\n",
      "Apart from spirit there could be no community, for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence.\n",
      "Every community, if it is alive has a spirit, and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity.\n",
      "In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful.\n",
      "For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit.\n",
      "It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere.\n",
      "It is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers.\n",
      "It is they, of course, who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it.\n",
      "If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people'' -- and this, it must not be forgotten, is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation.\n",
      "This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.\n",
      "The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention.\n",
      "His point is not that mythology may not be used, but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma.\n",
      "When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence.\n",
      "Mythological concepts may by all means still be used, but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols'' or `` ciphers'', that is, only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological( or existential) terms.\n",
      "The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way, he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith''.\n",
      "If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements), the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant.\n",
      "Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated.\n",
      "On the contrary, even in the heart of `` the Bible belt'' itself, as can be attested by any one who is called to work there, the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way, together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world.\n",
      "In fact, it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed.\n",
      "Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation, the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence.\n",
      "Time and again in counseling and teaching, one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist'' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.\n",
      "The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism'' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches.\n",
      "In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion'' current in the situation.\n",
      "This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's `` cult of reassurance'' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel.\n",
      "But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.\n",
      "However, even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming, at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.\n",
      "To be sure, when this is pointed out, a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock'' and `` the great crowd'' and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise'' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians.\n",
      "Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly'' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom'', or, as is also commonly implied, that `` the foolishness of God'' and `` the foolishness of men'' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing??\n",
      "Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious??\n",
      "There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church( which derives, however, from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.\n",
      "By analogy, the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world'' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church.\n",
      "But, as Scripture everywhere reminds us, God does have need of his creatures, and the church, a fortiori, can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world, by God's providence, presents it.\n",
      "And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men.\n",
      "Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.\n",
      "In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved;;\n",
      "and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction.\n",
      "But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible, the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable.\n",
      "If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no, or where I do not have the right to say anything at all, then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian.\n",
      "Expressed differently: if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction, whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis, sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.\n",
      "This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter.\n",
      "and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation, it is still a positive step forward;;\n",
      "and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it.\n",
      "In any event, it is an irreversible step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us.\n",
      "To say this, of course, is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years, or, at any rate, since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought.\n",
      "We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal'' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently, Schweitzer and the early Barth and, in part at least, Bultmann.\n",
      "It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong.\n",
      "For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch, not to mention those of `` the Chicago School'' and Macintosh, but those of the brothers Niebuhr and( if America may claim him!!\n",
      ") Tillich as well.\n",
      "Finally, we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal'' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead.\n",
      "What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world.\n",
      "Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church, they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity.\n",
      "They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely within modern culture and, so far from considering this treason to God, have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.\n",
      "When we say, then, that today, in our situation, the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition, we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement.\n",
      "However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism, not behind it.\n",
      "In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led.\n",
      "For we have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion, only one is really an alternative.\n",
      "It follows, then, provided the possibilities have been exhausted, that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left'', which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent at least, is found in much that is significant in American and English theology.\n",
      "In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible, we may develop this argument at greater length.\n",
      "We may show, first, that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri.\n",
      "To do this, it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two, then the question of a `` third'' possibility is a meaningless question.\n",
      "Therefore, the only conceivable alternatives are those represented, on the one hand, by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and, on the other hand, by the third but really pseudo position( analogous to a round square) of Bultmann.\n",
      "It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right'', as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis: The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that( 1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation;;\n",
      "and( 3) in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of view, are mythological.\n",
      "Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches, and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome, this association produced little fruit, and, in fact, was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.\n",

      "Many people seem hopeful, yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861.\n",

      "From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services.\n",
      "The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches.\n",
      "According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England, the `` total of confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls'', and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England, but roughly only a tenth of them continue''.\n",
      "An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November, entitled `` Fate Of Redundant Churches'', states than an Archbishops' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now, or will be in 20 years' time.\n",
      "Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses, but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics'', and have done so.\n",
      "While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period, and that religious population shifts have emptied churches, a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church.\n",
      "It should be admitted, too, that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics( one paper writes 50 per cent).\n",
      "Still, it is clear from such reports, and apparently clear from the remarks of many people, that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing.\n",
      "An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true.\n",
      "A century ago, Newman saw that liberalism( what we now might call secularism) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own''.\n",
      "That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country''.\n",
      "One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively speaking, many real Christians to unite.\n",

      "One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.\n",
      "Moreover, for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs.\n",

      "Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster;;\n",
      "the similitude of God, by contrast, is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature.\n",
      "Recent research on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction.\n",
      "He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall;;\n",
      "for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.\n",
      "`` So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur, and become lifted up, as if he had no lord, because of the dominion that had been given to him, and the freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, overstepping his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God, a law was given him by God, that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all.\n",
      "And He laid down for him certain conditions: so that, if he kept the command of God, then he would always remain as he was, that is, immortal;;\n",
      "The true way to immortality lay through obedience, but man did not believe this.\n",
      "And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin, having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race;;\n",
      "so also did Mary, having a man betrothed( to her), and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race''.\n",
      "Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children, Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still wicked''.\n",
      "His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary.\n",
      "for as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue man, so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world, and all our woe.\n",
      "With this act of disobedience, and not with the inception of his individual existence, man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality.\n",
      "At the nadir of that circuit is death.\n",
      "and disobedience to God entails death.\n",
      "Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from that( moment) they were handed over to it''.\n",
      "This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday;;\n",
      "he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.\n",
      "Man's life, originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God, must now be conformed to the shape of death.\n",
      "Nevertheless, even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God, and he still rules.\n",
      "Even death, therefore, has a providential as well as a punitive function.\n",
      "`` Wherefore also He( God) drove him( man) out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture to assert, but because He pitied him,( and did not desire) that he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable.\n",
      "But He set a bound to his( state of) sin, by interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God''.\n",
      "This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology;;\n",
      "for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ.\n",
      "As man can live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life.\n",
      "It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is.\n",
      "This applies to his picture of Adam.\n",
      "It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next.\n",
      "It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality.\n",
      "They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility, which can mean( though it does not have to mean) deliverance from time and history.\n",
      "It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves, but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time.\n",
      "The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated.\n",
      "Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older, in short, whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time.\n",
      "If it was, then it must have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity.\n",
      "The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change.\n",
      "On the other hand, Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence.\n",
      "If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination, the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator.\n",
      "This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced.\n",
      "If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal, i.e., created, existence.\n",
      "Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist thinking, it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes.\n",
      "Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable representative of the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist.\n",
      "Even so, Gannett judiciously argued, the Association could legitimately decide that Parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness''.\n",
      "We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations.\n",
      "One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church, and so to suppress it, rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it.\n",
      "Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen, as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father, they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians.\n",
      "Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry'' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural'' religion.\n",
      "Grant all this -- still, when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them, or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience.\n",
      "Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23, 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association, while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating, `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity;;\n",
      "the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity'' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances, the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief, of positive thanksgiving, that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker.\n",
      "Had it done so, the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible, nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi''.\n",
      "Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room, though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality.\n",
      "Fortunately, the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins;;\n",
      "whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room, though not out of the Fellowship.\n",
      "In the hall, after adjournment, Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears.\n",
      "All this near tragedy, which to us borders on comedy, enables us to tell the story over and over again, always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency.\n",
      "To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it.\n",
      "Yet, even after all these stratagems, the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest, any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.\n",
      "In both cases the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates, both legitimate offspring of its loins, and when brought to the test, it behaved shabbily.\n",
      "Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about??\n",
      "Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick the wound of his departure, preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration.\n",
      "Parker insisted upon not resigning, even when the majority wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out.\n",
      "He still points an accusing finger at all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat.\n",
      "It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him.\n",
      "The fact is incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm, and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened.\n",
      "But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem, which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom.\n",
      "Even though his theological theses have become, to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us.\n",
      "It has been endlessly rephrased, but I may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant??\n",
      "And then, as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience, what do they, to their dismay, learn for the first time about themselves??\n",
      "There can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior.\n",
      "The gentle Channing, revered by all Bostonians, orthodox or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action: `` No city in the world is governed so little by a police, and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.\n",
      "-- that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart, should he `` speak without book, and consequently break some law of speech, or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should find little mercy''.\n",
      "I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons.\n",
      "But Theodore Parker, commencing his mission to the world-at-large, disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth Congregational Church'' which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders( among which were still the Unitarian churches), made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum.\n",
      "Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.\n",
      "By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation, we should, I am sure, come to a fresh realization, however painful it be, that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest.\n",
      "He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with, at the least, resentment.\n",
      "What otherwise could `` the lawyer, doctor, minister, the men of science and letters'' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant, and continually cried,' Holy, holy, holy is the Almighty Dollar' ``??\n",
      "Nor, when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus: `` Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells!!\n",
      "There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre on their head, who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, a pope much nearer home.\n",
      "Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists, lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think''.\n",
      "And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them: `` Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria, and are worse than those who deceived them'' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed.\n",
      "It was `` Duty'' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty.\n",
      "Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents.\n",
      "`` If it gave me pleasure to say hard things'', he wrote, `` I would shut up forever''.\n",
      "We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein, he believed what he said, because he could continue, `` But the truth, which cost me bitter tears to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter than fire''.\n",
      "Because he copiously shed his own tears, and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England, he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences.\n",
      "Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival, that of the literal, factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels.\n",
      "It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing the deepest piety, decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.M. on the third of August, A.D. 32.\n",
      "We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed.\n",
      "So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy, to salute his courage, and to pass on, happily forgetting both him and the entire episode.\n",
      "We have not the leisure, or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor, the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying that, while he believed Jesus `` like other religious teachers'', worked miracles, `` I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine''.\n",
      "It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions, the nature of the hope of a life beyond this.\n",
      "I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world.\n",
      "At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a `` Higher Criticism'' of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.\n",
      "Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and, like some higher critical friends, trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations: attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent, Bible-loving generation and a critical, doubting, Bible-emancipated race.\n",
      "In one thing the higher critics, like the modernists, however, overreached themselves, in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A.D..\n",
      "To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible.\n",
      "Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path, to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works.\n",
      "So, I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself, and then tested it to see how it worked.\n",
      "As a short, possibly not the best method, I looked up `` Word'' in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal message to man.\n",
      "The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science'', and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that, `` If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself''( John 7: 17).\n",
      "I believe, therefore, that we are without exception sinners, by nature alienated from God, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth, the representative Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is `` born again'' spiritually, with new privileges, appetites, and affections, destined to live and grow in His likeness forever.\n",
      "I now ever look for Christ according to His promises and those of the Old Testament as well, to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth.\n",
      "To state fully what the Bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends.\n",
      "I place His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability, dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to Him.\n",
      "I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ, who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him even though called to stand alone before the world.\n",
      "Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is, `` Come and see''.\n",
      "As I ministered to his needs, I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the Lord.\n",
      "In his heart he had that peace of which the Lord spoke when He said, `` Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\n",
      "What a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him.\n",
      "He was about to leave them, to depart from this world, and return to His Father in Heaven.\n",
      "Before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds.\n",
      "I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n",
      "It makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.\n",
      "How often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room, asking for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures.\n",
      "As only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family, likewise one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own.\n",
      "Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him.\n",
      "You may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father.\n"

      "yet some must have survived, because the old interest in number symbolism, divination, and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period( from 202 B.C. to A.D. 220).\n",
      "In fact, during the first century B.C., an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects, finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books'', a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams, especially in connection with divination.\n",

      "Although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three'', a mere `` mathematical puzzle'', was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries, they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself.\n",
      "But, up to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties, or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts.\n",
      "Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo Shu, 5, was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram.\n",
      "The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations, which is to say, any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it.\n",
      "Then, if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square, through multiplying it by the highest number, 9( which is the square of the base number), the result is 45;;\n",
      "and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square, by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.\n",
      "it is also their mathematical mean, since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which equal 10.\n",
      "and in this square, the respective pairs made up of large and small odd( Yang) numbers, and those composed of large and small even( Yin) numbers, were all equal to each other.\n",
      "The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe, could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5, and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality.\n",
      "These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty.\n",
      "The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B.C., when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would thus place himself, his imperial family, and the nation under the most auspicious influences.\n",
      "After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors, as well as other writings, emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest.\n",
      "All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.C., also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five.\n",
      "This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself, as though they had served as the base for all the rest;;\n",
      "but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements, when the Ancient Near East -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four??\n",
      "And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions, when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four??\n",
      "Obviously, something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives, and that may have been the workings of the Lo Shu.\n",
      "Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers, until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought.\n",
      "Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature, or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things, in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical, and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries.\n",
      "Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu, and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it, might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers, this was actually only a beginning of wonders.\n",
      "but, conversely, one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese, which they felt they saw expressed in it.\n",
      "The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty, when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity, was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School, which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen.\n",
      "According to this doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven, T'ien -- as a natural force, or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao, which can be roughly interpreted as `` the Order of the Universe'' or `` the Universal Way''.\n",
      "We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center.\n",
      "During the Han dynasty, another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu, considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China.\n",
      "For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai, to the( then) Southeast;;\n",
      "Note that by Western standards this plan was `` upside down'', as it put North at the bottom and South at the top, with the other directions correspondingly altered;;\n",

      "A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship.\n",
      "In the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church.\n",
      "The first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church.\n",
      "churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active.\n",
      "This is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency''.\n",
      "It is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant.\n",
      "It is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.\n",
      "The pastor writes a personal letter to each individual, expressing his joy over the decision, assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time, and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday.\n",
      "If possible, he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present.\n",
      "Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows.\n",

      "Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes.\n",
      "most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday.\n",
      "In this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church.\n",
      "The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life, service opportunities, the church school, missions, men's work, women's work, youth program, social activities, and finances.\n",
      "The social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members.\n",
      "in conducting the Membership Preparation-Inquirers' Class, the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class.\n",
      "Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session.\n",

      "They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.\n",
      "Every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of fellowship, the introduction to the congregation, the welcome of the congregation.\n",
      "It will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church.\n",
      "The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church.\n",

      "everyone is to be a participant.\n",
      "Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating, growing parts of the fellowship.\n",
      "A study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church were lost to the Church within seven years.\n",
      "These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership.\n",
      "This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.\n",
      "Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where population is expanding, show that numbers of churches have had little net increase, though many new members were received.\n",
      "The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process.\n",
      "If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way.\n",
      "However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship.\n",
      "Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him, but with these two qualifications, the statement stands.\n",
      "The statement also points to a classic paradox: The more men turn toward God, who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established, the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another.\n",
      "To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the human race.\n",
      "The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind: `` Oh how we hate one another for the love of God''!!\n",

      "For every criterion which defines what something is, at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not.\n",
      "Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether;;\n",
      "in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification, we ought to dispense with churches.\n",
      "Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance.\n",
      "To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools.\n",
      "As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God, they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him.\n",
      "Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows.\n",
      "The only way that I can see is through communication.\n",
      "It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite, of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary.\n",
      "Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all, but by the need of men to have persons they can blame, distrust, denounce, and even hate.\n",
      "Such needs may rise to pathological proportions.\n",
      "Modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality'' is `` the bigoted personality'' in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally.\n",
      "Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small, but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us.\n",
      "To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.\n",
      "It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts for them, that are causing the trouble, and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.\n",
      "While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable.\n",
      "Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination, the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.\n",
      "As an obvious consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between Christians and non-Christians in these lands.\n",
      "Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious, for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other.\n",
      "Actually, however, this turns out to be only part of the picture.\n",
      "The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need.\n",
      "Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate, trans-political justifications for their existence, such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's.\n",
      "Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda.\n",

      "I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program.\n",
      "He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks, but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.\n",
      "After returning to the United States and raising the money, he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available.\n",
      "It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval;;\n",
      "It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment.\n",
      "Although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non-Christians in Asia, the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions themselves.\n",
      "I turn finally to several theological developments.\n",
      "The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state, whatever its political form.\n",
      "The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof''.\n",
      "One of our foremost jurists, David Dudley Field, has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history''.\n",
      "Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation.\n",
      "During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties.\n",
      "Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise.\n",
      "And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state.\n",
      "The failure at that time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument.\n",
      "Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word, too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine.\n",

      "That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed.\n",
      "I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism, that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit.\n",
      "Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says, `` We must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work, but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it''.\n",
      "The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church.\n",

      "When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit'' the termination of the human race by human action, because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing, they know exactly what they mean.\n",
      "Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently grave, to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.\n",
      "I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit''.\n",
      "He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result) as it efficaciously does some good.\n",
      "of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended, but still both are done, while the evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part of the agent, foreknown to be among the consequences.\n",
      "This is what, in a technical sense, to `` only permit'' an evil result means.\n",
      "It means to do it and to know one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends.\n",
      "Of course, grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation, or to the action of any leader or leaders, which for any supposed good `` permits'', in this sense, the termination of the human race by human action.\n",
      "Certainly, in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives, `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds, and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative''.\n",
      "Naturally, where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain, this has to be taken into account.\n",
      "Presumably, if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming, not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account.\n",
      "If an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic, speculative, future good, by the same token not every present, certain, and immediate good( or lesser evil) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative, and future evil.\n",
      "Nevertheless, according to the traditional theory, a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.\n",
      "He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action.\n",
      "By contrast, a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities, and not with the moral nature of the action to be done;;\n",
      "and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result, whether by anyone's doing or by accident, it finds itself driven to inaction, to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs, and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based.\n",
      "Mr. Philip Toynbee writes, for example, that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues.\n",
      "If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin''.\n",
      "Against such a termination of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available'', that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness''.\n",
      "He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically, i.e., by considering the worst possible outcome, namely, the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years.\n",
      "This would be by far the better choice, when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive, possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest, or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish''.\n",
      "If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms, then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test'': `` Have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are''??\n",
      "it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself, its intention, and proximate effect or the thing to be done.\n",
      "Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee, without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made, by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil.\n",
      "`` It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation''.\n",
      "`` I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of' race suicide by accident' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design.\n",

      ") `` Quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war, he( Toynbee) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war''.\n",
      "`` If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility, most men will choose the latter''.\n",
      "`` If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war, I think he is right.\n",
      "I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war''.\n",
      "Even Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with his son, does so in these terms: `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race, all other evils are lesser evils.\n",
      "Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four, if he believed Communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil'', then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world.\n",
      "Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday''.\n",
      "No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature.\n",
      "But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense, or a static order in which no changes will take place in time, to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force.\n",
      "On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation.\n",
      "Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment, but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.\n",
      "Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment.\n",
      "He does not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition, that `` if we took the risk of surrendering, a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender''.\n",
      "He wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far, far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956''.\n",
      "It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it, or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it, in the past.\n",
      "`` It is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples.\n",
      "Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop''.\n",
      "This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted, to the very last;;\n",
      "it is to stride along the steep slope downward.\n",
      "and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will, by human action, render this planet less habitable by the human race.\n",
      "That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted'' effects, and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally related, to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.\n",
      "Finally, just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth, but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination, the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing, by human action, to accelerate this end.\n",
      "We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future.\n",
      "Much more than shelter, housing symbolizes social status, a sense of `` belonging'', acceptance within a given group or neighborhood, identification with particular cultural values and social institutions, feelings of pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being.\n",

      "It is not surprising that, as spokesman for real estate interests, the National Association of Real Estate Boards( NAREB) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.\n",
      "What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest??\n",
      "What ought to be, what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change??\n",
      "What social, ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation??\n",
      "Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions.\n",
      "Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers, political scientists, economists, social psychologists, social ethicists and theologians.\n",
      "Here, in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it.\n",
      "For a number of years, Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body, attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy.\n",
      "This article presents our observations of that session, of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them.\n",
      "Within the membership of this group, as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations, the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public'' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them.\n",
      "Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner.\n",
      "But as conversation goes on, particularly among the realtors themselves, another image emerges, that of considerable power and influence in the community.\n",
      "and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial'', `` happy'' relations to other people in certain community areas.\n",
      "How explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code, adopted in 1924, states that `` a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood''.\n",
      "Though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950, being an agent of such `` detrimental'' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid.\n",
      "all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white, particularly Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas.\n",
      "They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals'' but agitators for some kind of `` cause'' or `` reform'', and this was no longer to be a `` pro''.\n",
      "Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional'' with narrow skills and specialization, the effective servicing of a client, rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work.\n",
      "These men -- for the most part educated in our `` best'' New England colleges, well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing, reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve, or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship''.\n",
      "From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding.\n",
      "It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas:( 1) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue;;\n",
      "and, most pervasively,( 3) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro'', of what it means to be a professional man in a technical, fragmented society.\n",
      "( 1) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue, pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.\n",
      "There is some reality to this;;\n",
      "the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any other segment of the American population''.\n",
      "Like business and university groups generally, these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make.\n",
      "Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others, however, point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.\n",
      "There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values, the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc..\n",
      "Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in.\n",
      "Often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically.\n",
      "Significantly, no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes( published by the University of California Press) that present the commission's findings.\n",
      "Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity, the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality, and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife.\n",
      "( 2) Realtors realize, of course, that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing.\n",
      "Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest, for example, in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey'', but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record.\n",
      "There are sins of omission as well as commission;;\n",
      "the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations, either negative or positive, plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced.\n",
      "Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry, but there is little evidence that realtors, or at least their associations, have repudiated the principle in such clauses.\n",
      "In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism'' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid.\n",
      "But as yet, no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods.\n",
      "One of the roles of the social scientist, ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work.\n",
      "But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional, white, American good.\n",
      "Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world, let us say a community, that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.\n",
      "Racial discrimination is wrong, then, not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator.\n",
      "But what significance attaches to `` professional'', beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already noted??\n",
      "As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional was, before the modern period of technical specialization, one who `` professed'' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills.\n",
      "If we look about the world today, we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization: science and religion.\n",
      "Religion, or the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind, or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed.\n",
      "How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge??\n",
      "And yet there is a note of hope, because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision.\n",
      "We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material, a universe that in a word is not matter but music.\n",
      "And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith.\n"

      "And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom, according to the physics of forty years ago, you would see circulating over your head, down at the sides, and under your feet, some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.\n",
      "These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses, and are of course, the electrons, the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.\n",

      "Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing.\n",
      "For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics;;\n",

      "At times we can say that it was the major factor.\n",
      "Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent.\n",
      "Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse.\n",
      "The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock, for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration;;\n",
      "Yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible.\n",
      "For instance, we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose.\n",
      "The temptation is to say that, as the percentage of church members mounted, the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level.\n",
      "We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed.\n",
      "Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting, malicious gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities, gambling, horse racing, and failure to pay just debts.\n",
      "What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation.\n",

      "With such a dream arising, at least in part, from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation, it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression.\n",
      "A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills.\n",
      "We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American Home Missionary Society, the American Bible Society, and New England theology.\n",
      "The atmosphere was one of optimism, of confidence in human progress, and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.\n",
      "The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence, although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election, inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others, looked for the early coming of the Millennium, and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.\n",
      "We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills.\n",

      "The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until, as a result of the Civil War, emancipation was achieved.\n",
      "Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly.\n",
      "For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply.\n",
      "In the latter year Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name, asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery.\n",
      "The nineteenth-century immigration, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much concerned, for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out, or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.\n",
      "It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison( 1805-1879) to the subject.\n",
      "Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition'', he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the Indians.\n",
      "A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals.\n",
      "Finney himself, while opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis on evangelism, but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign.\n",
      "As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men.\n",
      "A strong temperance advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher, Charles Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause.\n",
      "A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position.\n",
      "The majority then went to the infant Oberlin.\n",
      "They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause.\n",
      "Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton, enlisted John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.\n",

      "Although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout Christian.\n",
      "Thus, the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors.\n",
      "Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living.\n",
      "The royal ritual generated power into the other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits, and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world.\n",
      "His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions.\n",
      "Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family, outrages to community propriety, any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead.\n",
      "And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters.\n",
      "The common belief was that there existed one moral order, which included everything.\n",
      "The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living, and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control.\n",
      "Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material, largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection.\n",
      "Living in urban conditions, away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view, the individual may find it possible, say, to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings, but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes.\n",
      "Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns.\n",
      "It was this timeless unity that was all-important, and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality.\n",
      "Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts.\n",
      "During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader.\n",
      "The Mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic, that made the world into a huge magical garden.\n",
      "In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks( bonzes), who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.\n",
      "Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.\n",
      "Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism.\n",
      "But the `` marvelous person'' that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers, and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls.\n",
      "Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen, probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic.\n",
      "But in the Chinese mind, there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.\n",
      "Actually, Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism.\n",
      "This is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen: the idea of the inward turning of thought, the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity, peace, and stillness -- a union with the Infinite, with the Tao -- could be effected.\n",
      "In fact, the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking'' Zennist was a feature of Taoism.\n",
      "So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the external world, and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure, indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness.\n",
      "Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience.\n",
      "One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts.\n",
      "One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse.\n",
      "It is simply that in Taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books, words, or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience.\n",
      "Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge, but a positive handicap.\n",
      "The technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century B.C. Chinese Quietism: the koan is not basically a new device.\n",
      "It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man.\n",
      "But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.\n",
      "The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.\n",
      "Thus, the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for this reason, the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation.\n",
      "As the Zen literature reveals, as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion, he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.\n",
      "The early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles.\n",
      "Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China, and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous view of the universe.\n",
      "In support of this, stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power.\n",
      "But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity: `` Hwang Pah( O Baku), one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.\n",
      "They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent.\n",
      "There being no bridge, the master had to stop at the shore;;\n",
      "but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him.\n",
      "When that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation, he asked: `` Where art thou from''??\n",
      "`` I stopped'', responded the man, `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries''.\n",
      "`` Thou mayst have supernatural powers'', exclaimed Yang Shan, `` yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me''.\n",
      "Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying: `` I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri, and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya'', and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India, went back through the air.\n",
      "In the popular Chinese mind, Ch'an( Zen) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated.\n",
      "A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes.\n",
      "To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings'' who have to be appeased.\n",
      "Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings''.\n",
      "Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire, action is based on direct self-confidence, and so on.\n",
      "This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as: `` O you, demons and other spiritual beings, I now offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith.\n",
      "Pope Leo 13, on the 13th day of December 1898, granted the following indulgences: `` An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour.\n",
      "Pope Pius the Sixth, at Rome, in April, 1778, wrote the following: `` The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures: For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone, to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times''.\n",
      "The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible.\n",
      "`` We hope'', they said, `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures''.\n",
      "They recommended, also, that `` at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures''.\n",

      "Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates!!\n",
      "Far from discouraging Henri, his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.\n",
      "Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority, Professor Roland Claude.\n",
      "And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur'' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still, he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast, fast muscle growth.\n",
      "Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'''' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight.\n",
      "About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining.\n",
      "Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein, those two wonder-working Weider food supplements, he decided to try them and see what they could do for him.\n",
      "For in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly.\n",
      "Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.\n",
      "`` It never seemed to widen.\n",
      "That's when he went to Professor Claude.\n",
      "And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it.\n",
      "So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon'' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover( the `` pull'' part of the Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide, Reeves-type `` gladiator'' pecs, while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids.\n",
      "The `` push'' exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.\n",
      "You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs.\n",
      "The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj.\n",
      "As you see, the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip.\n",
      "He has to;;\n",
      "By this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work.\n",
      "He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press( note the high incline).\n",
      "This gives a wide flare to the pecs, causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj.\n",
      "This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests;;\n",
      "that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock'' looks of the great champions.\n",
      "So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1, four of No. 2, four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon.\n",
      "The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles.\n",
      "Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts.\n",
      "But contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different.\n",
      "Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.\n",
      "It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders;;\n",
      "a criterion of muscle `` drama'' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike;;\n",

      "The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, but it is still firm at this point.\n",
      "It is brought to packing houses, cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective excelsior.\n",
      "The fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-F., a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state.\n",
      "One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind.\n",
      "It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the consumer.\n",

      "They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol level of their blood.\n",

      "A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets.\n",
      "It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people.\n",
      "and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes.\n",
      "At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities, being `` soft'', and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.\n",
      "However, because this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.\n",
      "It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.\n",

      "If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles.\n",
      "We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile.\n",
      "One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target, decide that it is worthy of destruction, select the missile to be fired against the target, compute ballistics for the flight, and prepare the missile for firing.\n",
      "Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously, the ICBM still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes.\n",
      "Because of this, it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.\n",
      "In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles.\n",
      "Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us.\n",
      "It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.\n",
      "Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force.\n",
      "It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles.\n",
      "If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons.\n",
      "An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia -- provided that we had used some of our ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there.\n",
      "The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile.\n",
      "Is there any other way to do the job??\n",
      "Survivability of our strategic forces( Polaris, mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne Skybolt) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy a strategic force.\n",
      "Forces will survive a surprise attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration, to the conflict.\n",
      "They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile.\n",
      "Some day, many years in the future, true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets.\n",
      "But until we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft.\n",
      "However, the aircraft which we have today are tied to large, `` soft'' airfields.\n",
      "Here then is our problem: aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing;;\n",
      "But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the airfield.\n",
      "Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles.\n",
      "There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:\n",
      "Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life.\n",
      "We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj.\n",
      "Large, long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful engines than we have today.\n",
      "There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.\n",
      "This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.\n",
      "If, for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one.\n",
      "The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete.\n",
      "When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields, they are no longer vulnerable to Aj.\n",
      "If our SAC bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again, and again, and again, those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance.\n",
      "We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile.\n",
      "With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating.\n",
      "No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.\n",
      "But in the case of moving targets, and targets which have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to destroy them??\n",
      "What targets still remain to be hit??\n",
      "SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark.\n",
      "Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target.\n",
      "Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably.\n",
      "It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance.\n",
      "It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.\n",
      "Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet.\n",
      "Or put another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead( 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!!\n",
      "Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc..\n",
      "With these keen `` eyes'' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas.\n",
      "If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision, and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace, our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.\n",
      "Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument generally regarded as symphonic.\n",
      "The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing.\n",
      "Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances.\n",
      "Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first.\n",
      "Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions, COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.\n",
      "But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils( Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher, and Victor Babin) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills.\n",
      "Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions, most notably the `` Schnabel trill''( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously).\n",
      "But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own.\n",
      "Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one.\n",
      "Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity.\n",
      "And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.\n",
      "The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives.\n",
      "I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group.\n",
      "From a technical standpoint, the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here.\n",
      "There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen'' movement, and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj.\n",
      "Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's( London) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work.\n",
      "Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out, and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout.\n",
      "( Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp: his scrawny, tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance.\n",
      "But having lived with the disc for some time now, I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's.\n",
      "Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound on his Decca disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it.\n",
      "Helmut Roloff, playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists.\n",
      "Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue, I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration.\n",
      "Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century'', and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect.\n",
      "From the beginning of commercial recording, new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation.\n",
      "Seen in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.\n",
      "Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics.\n",
      "If we return to them today, we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing.\n",
      "Some of them are obvious, such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings.\n",
      "( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat.\n",
      ") From the technical standpoint, records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity, pulse, and pitch of the original.\n",
      "Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion, although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.\n",
      "Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness, that makes records sound like records.\n",
      "but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation.\n",
      "Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one.\n",
      "Because of this, only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph.\n",
      "The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values.\n",
      "The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes, valve clicks, and other noises incidental to playing.\n",
      "The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority;;\n",
      "The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.\n",
      "Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper.\n",
      "Those accustomed to broader, more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one.\n",
      "Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.\n",
      "The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you, as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet.\n",
      "In the end, however, the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings.\n",
      "Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score, and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.\n",
      "Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment.\n",
      "The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration.\n",
      "Your ear takes you into the ensemble, and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score.\n",
      "It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener.\n",
      "The first substantially complete stereo Giselle( and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment.\n",
      "And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance, the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity''.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class.\n",
      "As has been the custom for the past several years, John Cross, Jr., Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster, arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class, and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them.\n",
      "Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs. Long advised the Juniors: `` When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement, stop!!\n",
      "When you and your dog step into the Junior ring, it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do.\n",
      "If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel it and give you a good performance!!\n",
      "Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop!!\n",
      "Or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look, or the date you have after the Class, or you are just doing this to please the parents.\n",
      "`` The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce.\n",
      "`` Your aids are your attitude, which comes through your voice, your hands and legs -- voice to encourage, discourage or whatever the need may be;;\n",
      "hands to guide or restrain;;\n",
      "legs to produce motion and rate of speed.\n",
      "And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come''!!\n",
      "He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.\n",
      "He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division!!\n",
      "This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them!!\n",
      "Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their dogs.\n",
      "From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually.\n",
      "This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 45 minutes to judge the Class.\n",
      "This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.\n",
      "As the Juniors entered the ring, Mr. Spring, the announcer, stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition.\n",
      "Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club, recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year.\n",
      "( The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen.\n",
      "It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered.\n",
      "A large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.\n",
      "Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year.\n",
      "In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year, she also scored with an Afghan.\n",
      "Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well.\n",
      "Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster.\n",
      "Percy Roberts, a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March.\n",
      "It has been suggested many times that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter the Junior Classes.\n",
      "For some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.\n",
      "Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class, but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day.\n",
      "The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge.\n",
      "At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world.\n",
      "Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them.\n",
      "More volunteer handlers needed to judge\n",
      "Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition.\n",
      "The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr.( for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.\n",
      "Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog.\n",
      "To overcome this unfair judging, the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class.\n",
      "If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class.\n",
      "By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will be helping to create future dog owners.\n",
      "The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show.\n",

      "Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.\n",
      "Many a motel owner -- when we've stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.\n",
      "Is it that they don't care??\n",

      "At one time, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States Navy.\n",
      "Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport.\n",
      "Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea.\n",
      "But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock.\n",
      "In 1959, according to the Engineers, Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons.\n",
      "Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people, means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water.\n",
      "It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new, light, strong, easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000.\n",
      "Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft, will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car, driving to the water, and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat.\n",
      "Today, the boat, on its trailer, is brought to the gear and loaded at the door.\n",
      "Arriving at the waterside, the boat is launched, the family taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is begun.\n",
      "And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago.\n",
      "This year, Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national, regional and local boat shows.\n",
      "The boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons.\n",
      "They range from an eight-foot pram, which you can build yourself for less than $50, to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000.\n",
      "Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs.\n",
      "There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget.\n",
      "There is no question as to just what is available.\n",
      "Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.\n",
      "I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors, Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run.\n",
      "Russia, whose technology is not quite primitive, is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor, for instance.\n",
      "The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower, unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production.\n",
      "Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook, the range being about $150 to $1,000, depending on size.\n",
      "Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country;;\n",
      "and to making the owning of a boat simpler.\n",
      "There was a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel.\n",
      "Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.\n",
      "Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles.\n",
      "When the automobile was in its embryonic stage, such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where, when and how fast a car could go.\n",
      "Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft.\n",
      "As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do;;\n"

      "lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy.\n",
      "Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting an intense, coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.\n",
      "With U.S. Coast Guard cooperation, the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety.\n",
      "In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment.\n",
      "A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe.\n",
      "In addition to these activities, the NAEBM, with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue, New York City, as well as other associations and individual manufacturers, provide and distribute films, booklets, and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat.\n",
      "It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.\n",
      "As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank deposit, the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them.\n",
      "The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort.\n",
      "Currently, marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available: gasoline, fresh water, electricity, telephone service, ice, repair facilities, restaurants, sleeping accommodations, a general store, and a grocery store.\n",
      "Yachtel, a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services.\n",
      "Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.\n",
      "It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards.\n",
      "A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States, the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats.\n",
      "The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle, but once understood, the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement.\n",
      "In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves.\n",
      "The main set of bars are the `` tappets'' and one tappet is connected to each lever.\n",
      "If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch, the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time.\n",
      "These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets.\n",
      "Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal.\n",
      "This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side, thus moving one or more locking bars.\n",
      "By this scheme, pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal.\n",
      "Interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red'' position, and a lever must be pulled to `` clear'' the signal.\n",
      "This is not necessarily to green, however, for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant''.\n",
      "A turnout may have two levers, one to actually move the switch points, the other to lock the points.\n",
      "The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point.\n",
      "Each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart'', a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled.\n",
      "The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.\n",
      "Derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop'' signal -- are used in many instances.\n",
      "You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish.\n",
      "Start with the right-hand piece `` B'', Af, soldering it to the lower piece `` A'' of the same material but 12'''' long.\n",

      "Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics.\n",
      "Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go'round would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating the things they discover and learn.\n",
      "Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential to any scientific endeavor.\n",
      "But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.\n",
      "however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding.\n",
      "It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed.\n",
      "The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula.\n",
      "This changes the formula to an `` equation''.\n",
      "They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes.\n",
      "However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order.\n",
      "The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other.\n",
      "It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row.\n",
      "Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order.\n",
      "When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct.\n",
      "The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers.\n",
      "When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value.\n",
      "Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication, subtraction, or addition steps: Af.\n",
      "For use in formulas, fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents.\n",
      "The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart.\n",
      "The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.\n",
      "A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation.\n",
      "Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.\n",
      "The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and, quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events.\n",
      "A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.\n",
      "Displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume''.\n",
      "It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed.\n",
      "Actually, the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine.\n",
      "The formula, with the fractions converted to decimals, becomes Af.\n",
      "To arrive at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right.\n",
      "To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level.\n",
      "Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface.\n",
      "This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.\n",
      "Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.\n",
      "Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters( cc.), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.\n",
      "However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters.\n",
      "The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms.\n",
      "Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation.\n",
      "The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume.\n",
      "Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position.\n",
      "Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.\n",
      "This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening.\n",
      "After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied to the following formula: Af\n",
      "For an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches.\n",
      "Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation: Af.\n",
      "The compression ratio is 10 to 1.\n",
      "This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads.\n",
      "Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed.\n",
      "The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position.\n",
      "There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire size.\n",
      "Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly.\n",
      "This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft.\n",
      "A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made.\n",
      "Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.\n",
      "For an engine speed of 5000 rpm, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this: Af\n",

      "You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most;;\n",
      "the time to decide on them is now.\n",
      "First on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.\n",
      "Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.\n",
      "Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker( under $110) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans;;\n",
      "it's a short, light, quick-handling, fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail.\n",
      "Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.\n",
      "The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me.\n",
      "After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery.\n",
      "We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, one could stray far out of the group.\n",
      "Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.\n",
      "But even without jacketed bullets, I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year.\n",
      "Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards.\n",
      "Three more deer have fallen to this same gun, and all were one-shot kills.\n",
      "My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels( before cutting to revolver length), and although it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.\n",
      "The most intriguing aspect of the S& W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard\n",
      "I tested it in my scoped S& W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily.\n",
      "The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers.\n",
      "Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles.\n",
      "Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle\n",

      "rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles.\n",
      "shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets.\n",
      "A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets.\n",
      "The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds.\n",
      "They'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark.\n",
      "The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds, right now!!\n",
      "Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961, with the addition of the and to the list of Model 725's.\n",
      "This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.\n",
      "The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate.\n",
      "A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster.\n",
      "The single-barrel Stevens 940Y( under $35) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily.\n",
      "There's another addition to the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in( under $75), which you may or may not consider a kid's gun;;\n",
      "For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under, the Broadway( from $350 up, depending on grade), differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.\n",
      "It's the Valmet( about $170), a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.\n",
      "High Standard has also added two models to its line.\n",

      "There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus, past ocean liners at anchor, to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus.\n",
      "Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque.\n",
      "On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square, with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque, which dates from the Seventeenth Century, just across from the entrance to the bridge.\n",
      "At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park.\n",
      "I got off there, crossed the street, walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left, the Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia.\n",
      "On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem.\n",
      "After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets.\n",
      "In the second half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome.\n",
      "Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple.\n",
      "On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing.\n",
      "Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen, mostly by the waves of Crusaders.\n",
      "Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius, originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose, who also built those now in New York, London and Rome at the Lateran.\n",
      "This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome, done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them.\n",
      "Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes.\n",
      "Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only one with six minarets, I entered the courtyard, with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle.\n",
      "One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century, with a huge central dome, two half domes that seem to cascade down from it, and smaller full domes around the gallery.\n",
      "The round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer.\n",
      "Back at the Kaiser's Fountain, I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the Burnt Column, at the top on my right.\n",
      "I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning right, it entered a huge square, Bayezit, with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it.\n",
      "There I got off, crossed the square, and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the city.\n",
      "After lunch, in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet, flaky cake -- in Istanbul.\n",
      "Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain, I walked ahead, then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small, one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace.\n",
      "Actually an underground cistern, its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars, it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water.\n",
      "Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia, turned left at the end of it, and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead.\n",
      "Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet.\n",
      "Passing through the gate, with towers on either side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings, and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds, with explanations in English for each building.\n"

      "Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position.\n",
      "The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved.\n",
      "Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key;;\n",

      "The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate.\n",
      "There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes.\n",
      "All will do a good job if sharp, but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts.\n",
      "The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade.\n",
      "Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed very slowly to avoid binding.\n",
      "Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers, keep your hands well out of the way.\n",

      "A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built.\n",
      "On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened.\n",
      "I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country.\n",
      "As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only, and had never seen a structure of this nature;;\n",
      "It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley;;\n",
      "that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old;;\n",
      "and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect, Moody Spofford.\n",
      "It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch, which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth, Haverhill, and Philadelphia.\n",
      "Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810.\n",
      "A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber.\n",
      "It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the first share-holders, stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion.\n",
      "The `` Essex Journal'' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge, which for elegance of style, propriety of speech or force of argument, was truly Ciceronian''.\n",
      "and, although he later explained that he was talking French, it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening.\n",
      "The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction, although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning.\n",
      "The southern half, however, on account of its underbracing, was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation.\n",
      "In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.\n",
      "Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge, in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.\n",
      "`` Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site, and lay out and superintend the work, or recommend a suitable person to execute it.\n",
      "Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site, May 28th to June 3rd.\n",
      "Colonel Frederick W. Lander, impersonated, will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's( now College) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's( West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.\n",
      "that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the'60s.\n",
      "The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements, war, fire, and floods, as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic, for more than a hundred years.\n",
      "It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.\n",
      "It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system, thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.\n",
      "This covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story.\n",
      "So frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia.\n",
      "The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders, and against the competition of other, and better known, bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered, wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.\n",
      "The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master piece, with its 139-foot, dual lane, span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders.\n",
      "Never rebuilt, the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers, a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic.\n",
      "During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior.\n",
      "Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather, and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.\n",
      "General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings, including the long bridge at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge, he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it.\n",
      "Reverend Joshual Corder, a Baptist minister, gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies, to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure;;\n",
      "he reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat.\n",
      "Jones relented, he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army, while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden.\n",
      "Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it, after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered, certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force.\n",
      "On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose.\n",
      "Centering around this historic old structure, a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events, beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd, to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.\n",
      "But problems cling to pools, as any pool owner knows.\n",
      "So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials, errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.\n",
      "Where to put it\n",
      "You are likely to be nearer the truth.\n",
      "You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters, the greater the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude.\n",
      "On the other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool.\n",
      "Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool.\n",
      "As in choosing a wife, it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good.\n",
      "In the colder climes, for instance, you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best.\n",
      "Even a neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.\n",
      "( We do, however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool.\n",
      "Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land.\n",
      "But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house.\n",
      "The placement of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety.\n",
      "Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet.\n",
      "Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation.\n",
      "We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards.\n",
      "From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks.\n",
      "Naive of us, maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool'' were both unexpected and unsettling.\n",
      "After the first few weeks, it was obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result.\n",
      "First and foremost: No one -- no, not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle.\n",
      "Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view.\n",
      "Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times.\n",
      "No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand.\n",
      "We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.\n",
      "And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities.\n",
      "A gaggle of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.\n",
      "No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run.\n",
      "( Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop.\n",
      "This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate'' than ours.\n",
      "We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.\n",
      "All dressing( undressing to be more exact) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes.\n",
      "( To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool, and the parking area.\n",
      "In many localities, now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum height of 5 feet.\n",
      "And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge.\n",
      "Our pools also have wide, shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.\n",
      "You should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.\n",
      "Unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and feeding -- from pH content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.\n",
      "Of course, if your pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores( you hope).\n",
      "A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis.\n",
      "With or without professional help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse.\n",
      "You should see to it that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean.\n",
      "You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water.\n",
      "You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing.\n",
      "As the pool is emptied, stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet.\n",
      "Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite if allowed to dry.\n",
      "If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out.\n",
      "If your pool is located on or near sloping ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris.\n",
      "It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around.\n",
      "Once on the water, these little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present.\n",
      "Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to brushes.\n",
      "Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one person( in the family or not) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job, with no chance for claiming, `` It wasn't my turn''.\n",
      "Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship.\n",
      "You may find yourself hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in.\n",
      "Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years.\n",
      "Fortunately, it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress.\n",
      "Even if you live above that line, the FHA will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged.\n",
      "New simplified packaged units, recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900.\n",
      "You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house.\n",
      "No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs.\n",
      "We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.\n",
      "We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling.\n",
      "Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.\n",
      "The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter loads for the washing machine.\n",
      "The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.\n",
      "Like its long-lived cousin, the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more.\n",
      "That brings its per-year cost down mighty low.\n",
      "But there's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build.\n",
      "If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building, by all means make provision for its easy adding later.\n",
      "If your house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of it.\n",
      "From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.\n",
      "If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for.\n",
      "Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.\n",
      "Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling.\n",
      "Be sure you get a perimeter heating system, and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating.\n",
      "You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house.\n",
      "The minimum cost for an average one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone.\n",
      "If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system.\n",
      "It is, in effect, an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.\n",
      "In a two-story house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor, another in the attic to cool the second.\n",
      "One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating.\n",
      "A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors.\n",
      "Now, the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees.\n",
      "Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery, or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant.\n",
      "The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load.\n"

      "A BTU is a unit of heat, and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour.\n",
      "A very rough rule of thumb is that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot of your house.\n",
      "You'll need more if the high average is above that, less if it's below.\n",
      "A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice.\n",
      "It is generally an inaccurate method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get.\n",
      "A 1-hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj.\n",
      "The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.\n",
      "Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough.\n",
      "Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big.\n",
      "An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly, then shut down for a long period.\n",
      "Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.\n",
      "If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit will have less heat to remove.\n",
      "If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises, fences and awnings.\n",
      "The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need.\n",
      "You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.\n",
      "Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house.\n",
      "They're easier to shade there.\n",
      "An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool.\n",
      "Gas adds to the moisture load.\n",
      "Insulate, weatherstrip, double-glaze to the maximum.\n",
      "In insulation, the numbers to remember are 6-4-2.\n",
      "Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling.\n",
      "It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary BTU is worth attention.\n",
      "It's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum.\n",
      "The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site.\n",
      "This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests, etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons.\n",
      "It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site.\n",
      "For site planning work, it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study.\n",
      "However, there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation.\n",
      "County judges, commissioners, engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences.\n",
      "A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.\n",
      "This, of course, depends on the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator, and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.\n",
      "It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone.\n",
      "Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.\n",
      "The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use.\n",
      "In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information to compare the site with others.\n",
      "You need answers to four important questions.\n",
      "How well can the site be developed??\n",
      "How useful will it be to the public??\n",
      "Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy.\n",
      "Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.\n",
      "A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area.\n",
      "Although the site may not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site.\n",
      "The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them.\n",
      "Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in.\n",
      "The historical sign tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered.\n",
      "Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites.\n",
      "An old shipwreck, a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest.\n",
      "How well can the site be developed??\n",
      "Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites.\n",
      "Many things need to be checked:\n",
      "Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.\n",
      "Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones.\n",
      "Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development.\n",
      "A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide.\n",
      "This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions.\n",
      "However, a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include scenic strips within the park unit.\n",
      "For instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not.\n",
      "The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site.\n",
      "Check the elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil.\n",
      "-- In addition to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation.\n",
      "The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines.\n",
      "Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas.\n",
      "Look at the trees as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, etcetera.\n",
      "Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared.\n",
      "The direction, velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area.\n",

      "Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff;;\n",
      "These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1, era.\n",
      "to the Neo-Classicists, it was a challenge to the pre-war world.\n",
      "What was it to Prokofieff??\n",
      "a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times;;\n",
      "His life-long friend, Serge Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C.,, to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation.\n",
      "`` Uncle Sam'' was, indeed, a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment and pleasure: `` The Golden Twenties''.\n",
      "We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky, Cocteau, Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.\n",
      "In this world-wide conscription of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his native land.\n",
      "The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission.\n",
      "In this changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create for large national purpose.\n",
      "Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.\n",
      "It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges.\n",
      "One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.\n",
      "He accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise.\n",
      "By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people: `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody.\n",
      "This is precisely what makes lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new, not old''.\n",
      "how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism.\n",
      "the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens.\n",
      "Also, it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound was required.\n",
      "That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original'' than we prefer to believe.\n",
      "Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated.\n",
      "At this date, it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History, as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose;;\n",
      "yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics.\n",
      "Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations.\n",
      "So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them.\n",
      "Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances.\n",
      "I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words: `` the clarity must be new, not old''.\n",
      "When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose'', he shaped his talents to his purpose.\n",
      "When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons, many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures.\n",
      "In all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples, time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments.\n",
      "Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials, and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka, his savage Sacre Du Printemps, his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed.\n",
      "But time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma.\n",
      "Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist;;\n",
      "a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto;;\n",
      "his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs!!\n",
      "Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for a home.\n",
      "Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction.\n",
      "In the process, his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose.\n",
      "With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and events, national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large.\n",
      "Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him;;\n",
      "It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.\n",
      "That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;;\n",
      "On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary.\n",
      "And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them.\n",
      "His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature.\n",
      "Out of this background of hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape.\n",
      "It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors.\n",
      "Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting.\n",
      "Like many others, he had to work hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures.\n",
      "On the death of their father, they returned to their home in Batavia, New York.\n",
      "During all this time Roy continued to paint, first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted, for longer periods.\n",
      "Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself.\n",
      "In the best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy and assurance, and then to paint.\n",
      "He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for his essays in the heavier medium.\n",
      "It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia.\n",
      "More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed, not imitative, painting.\n",
      "What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form;;\n",
      "color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;;\n",
      "and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark.\n",
      "`` Of late years, I find that I like best to work out-of-doors.\n",
      "First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale( approximately Af inches) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns.\n",
      "If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them in the initial sketch.\n",
      "For me, these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.\n",
      "`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him;;\n",
      "Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting, unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.\n",
      "Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position, which I call clicking.\n",
      "`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.\n",
      "`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition, I mean to project equal concern for color.\n",
      "Often, in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat.\n",
      "`` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.\n",
      "When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint image.\n",
      "The longer I work, the more I am sure that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important.\n",
      "I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain.\n",
      "In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes.\n",
      "Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board.\n",
      "`` In addition to the usual tools, I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes, but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights in dark washes.\n",
      "The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist.\n",
      "I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio.\n",
      "The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.\n",
      "In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness, yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here.\n",
      "Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate.\n",
      "Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes: a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights;;\n",
      "In following this general principle, Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background, and the illusion of depth is instantly created.\n",
      "When painting, Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey.\n",
      "rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia.\n",
      "It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment.\n",
      "Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor, a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all.\n",
      "The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia.\n",
      "When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist: the water sign of Pisces( February 18 thru March 20).\n",
      "And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again, in his natal month of March!!\n",
      "He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940.\n",
      "Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance.\n",
      "The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.\n",
      "After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition.\n",
      "But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves??\n",
      "It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem, for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics.\n",
      "It is made up of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work.\n",
      "In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well.\n",
      "The addition of endurance training later, when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury, provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier or citizen.\n",
      "Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life.\n",
      "If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools.\n",
      "Oddly enough, it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty.\n",
      "Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team.\n",
      "Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.\n",
      "And what has dancing to do with all this??\n",
      "Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest.\n",
      "President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation.\n",
      "To be fit, one has to start early with young children, and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance.\n",
      "If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much ahead.\n",
      "There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it.\n",
      "They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught.\n",
      "Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility.\n",
      "They often fail, however, to develop real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength.\n",
      "Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results, considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be very disappointing.\n",
      "This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once, and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test( even dashes and endurance).\n",
      "It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed under it, a little to one side.\n",
      "Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it.\n",
      "Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the top of the chin, let themselves slowly down.\n",
      "When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to chin-up.\n",
      "Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home.\n",
      "Keeping the hands in the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm.\n",
      "Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours, kicking as high as possible.\n",
      "Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor.\n",
      "Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength improves, fall farther and farther out.\n",
      "Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands.\n",
      "Let the body down slowly, taking at least five seconds for the letting down.\n",
      "At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone, and those who need help.\n",
      "Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back.\n",
      "Return to the standing position.\n",
      "Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible.\n",
      "Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg.\n",
      "Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time.\n",
      "The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and, as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results.\n",
      "Arch the back upwards to make a bridge.\n",
      "Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling.\n",
      "As flexibility improves, the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.\n",
      "Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.\n",
      "At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.\n",
      "The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault, or forward roll.\n",
      "This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks, but few children can do it today;;\n",
      "After it has been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees( a thin, inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling).\n",
      "He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping the chin down on the chest.\n",
      "These are beginnings, but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong, flexible body( we are not talking of eccentric extremes).\n",
      "It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative.\n",
      "And dancing school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more.\n",
      "Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics.\n",
      "The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.\n",
      "The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.\n",
      "The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery.\n",
      "Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine, the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine.\n",
      "From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research.\n",
      "Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation.\n",
      "A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results.\n",
      "By combining the talents of a medical man, Dr. Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr. Berkely, and an electronics expert, Dr. Zworykin, this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes.\n",
      "The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all lenses must be quartz.\n",
      "The video signal is amplified and then switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is seen.\n",
      "( Note: Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor.\n",
      "The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths.\n",
      "Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum.\n",
      "Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.\n",
      "The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation In Man'' by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young, covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process.\n",
      "This unit, affectionately dubbed `` The Monster'', can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing.\n",
      "In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath, the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other.\n",
      "One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched.\n",
      "Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.\n",
      "thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue.\n",
      "In addition to the heart and aorta, successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.\n",
      "The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.\n",
      "It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself.\n",
      "This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made.\n",
      "Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers.\n",
      "Battery life limited the use of this `` pill'' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum.\n",
      "The energy received by the `` pill'' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring'' on after the burst and this `` ringing'' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill''.\n",
      "One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill'' can remain in the patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions.\n",
      "Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments.\n",
      "Various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water.\n",
      "Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.\n",
      "Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals.\n",
      "Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through'' human organs.\n",
      "He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma.\n",
      "The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6.\n",
      "The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath, not shown.\n",
      "For display, Dr. Baum uses a portion of an Af, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record.\n",
      "The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into'' all corners.\n",
      "Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results.\n",
      "By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig. 7, as well as many other hitherto impossible insights.\n",
      "Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life.\n",
      "His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate them in a town without even a school.\n",
      "The two older boys, Hans and Anders, his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German;;\n",
      "his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish.\n",
      "Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal curriculum.\n",
      "Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching.\n",
      "Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other;;\n",
      "they read every book that they could borrow in the village.\n",
      "At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science.\n",
      "In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen( founded in 1479) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session.\n",
      "While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine, physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law.\n",
      "The brothers continued to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse, lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt.\n",
      "So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote, `` to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination;;\n",
      "there is a struggle there, in which, if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society.\n",
      "He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.\n",
      "The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr'', traveling in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling, Fichte, and Tieck.\n",
      "As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes( in Copenhagen I used 30) and intend to carry it with me''.\n",
      "With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind.\n",
      "Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs.\n",
      "The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him.\n",
      "In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.\n",
      "He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries.\n",
      "Thus, 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden'' jar by Kleist, 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile.\n",
      "Ritter proceeded, `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have to reckon.\n",
      "This we might well witness''.\n",
      "Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it.\n",
      "In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist.\n",
      "He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey( 1769-1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to his academic chair, was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy'' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him.\n",
      "In February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead.\n",
      "In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts.\n",
      "Eager as he was to pursue this promising line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing''.\n",
      "He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood.\n",
      "His broad interest in literary, political, and philosophical movements opened many doors to him.\n",
      "His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong.\n",
      "The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey.\n",
      "Chapter 8, is entitled `` On Magnetism'' and in it are included such remarks as, `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces.\n",
      "It is true, that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;;\n",
      "but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference.\n",
      "But in such an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is contrary to it.\n",
      "One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.\n",
      "It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb.\n",
      "By that, one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces.\n",
      "An attempt should be made to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the magnet as such''.\n",
      "In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship.\n",
      "He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current.\n",
      "In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm, one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition.\n",
      "It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition, Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow.\n",
      "Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles.\n",
      "Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic.\n",
      "The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820.\n",
      "At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle.\n",

      "Good service starts with product design and planning: Many products seem to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one.\n",
      "Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.\n",
      "The trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs.\n",
      "Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts.\n",

      "Have you examined these trends, forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances??\n",
      "In the area of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade.\n",
      "As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands tends to do.\n",
      "Moreover, the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on.\n",

      "Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.\n",

      "Are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers??\n",

      "The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building.\n",
      "Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables, workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is education.\n",
      "It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses, some even have six or more.\n",
      "The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training??\n",
      "An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design, for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art, and a further `` on the spot'' inspection of a number of schools, show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.\n",
      "One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum, but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.\n",
      "The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities.\n",
      "Obviously, the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.\n",
      "`` The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles'' published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows: `` Designs, plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television.\n",
      "Makes necessary purchases, places contracts, supervises construction, installation, finishing and placement of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings, and follows through to completion of project''.\n",
      "In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau, when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers, expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.\n",
      "And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.\n",
      "It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise.\n",
      "The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations.\n",
      "Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design.\n",
      "It is possible, of course, to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel'' of real interior design demands.\n",
      "It is like medical schools in India where, in that fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon.\n",
      "But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.\n",
      "Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men, fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work.\n",
      "Fortunately, although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length, today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student, not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade''.\n",
      "Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations, but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.\n",
      "Participation for the educator in this case, however, would have to be raised to full and complete membership.\n",
      "The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.\n",
      "This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students.\n",
      "In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools.\n",
      "Long hard years of `` on the job'' training had brought them to their competence.\n",
      "The necessity of that day has long disappeared.\n",
      "It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand.\n",
      "No one can deny that these `` back door'' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies.\n",
      "Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves.\n",
      "It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students.\n",
      "At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art''.\n",
      "We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education, experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.\n",
      "It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English, history, psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art, especially interior design, as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.\n",
      "One technical question of school organization comes to mind here.\n",
      "For proper accreditation of schools, teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.\n",
      "Indeed, it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all.\n",
      "The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree.\n",
      "This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.\n",
      "Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations.\n",
      "It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department.\n",
      "This, plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department, yet, nevertheless, claiming that they teach interior design, has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design.\n",
      "There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art''.\n",

      "Other THC activities followed, conducted by shopping centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-TV stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources.\n",
      "Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development program these shooting activities, and many others, including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.\n",
      "The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand.\n",
      "Since SAAMI's conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults.\n",
      "We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.\n",
      "Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition??\n",
      "Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves??\n",
      "We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks.\n",
      "With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now.\n",
      "Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look at the equipment and talk with the campers.\n",
      "Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.\n",
      "Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets.\n",
      "I've heard 10 million mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping.\n",
      "Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable.\n",
      "Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with.\n",
      "They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday weekends.\n",
      "The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present.\n",
      "They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance.\n",
      "There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds.\n",
      "Among them, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are:( 1) shorter work weeks,( 2) higher pay,( 3) longer paid vacations,( 4) better transportation,( 5) earlier retirement, and( 6) more education.\n",
      "The more people learn about their country, the more they want to learn.\n",
      "But make no mistake about it, the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy.\n"

      "Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper.\n",
      "and much more commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions.\n",
      "There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss.\n",
      "The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant, at special schools, or in university `` crash'' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates.\n",
      "But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer.\n",
      "Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success.\n",

      "usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles.\n",
      "Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men, and income tends to rise with title.\n",
      "It is, as one engineer says, `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills.\n",
      "This leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people''.\n",
      "Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers.\n",
      "So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up'' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions.\n",
      "In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page.\n",
      "Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric.\n",
      "Further, the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path.\n",
      "It is common to shift back and forth, working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.\n",
      "Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services'' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.\n",
      "Many companies have systems, particularly in R& D, which work more or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations.\n",
      "Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is, as one man says it: `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach''.\n",
      "There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;;\n",
      "the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.\n",
      "The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.\n",
      "The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels.\n",
      "We have set up a central R& D department, as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.\n",
      "A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future designs.\n",
      "These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president -- Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design;;\n",

      "I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability''.\n",
      "`` We have tried to make both paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either.\n",
      "One way to formalize this is in the job structure.\n",
      "We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president''.\n",
      "The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society.\n",
      "Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it.\n",
      "We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important;;\n",
      "and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the' dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions.\n",
      "With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance.\n",
      "and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work.\n",
      "These are only halfway measures, and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige''.\n",
      "The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision( engineering section head).\n",
      "We also have an' engineering section head -- research engineer' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer.\n",
      "`` We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a' professional' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence.\n",
      "These include encouragement of, and assistance to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.\n",
      "We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company, and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers.\n",
      "Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies.\n",
      "`` A recent, and more pertinent action, has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering.\n",
      "Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management.\n",
      "Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.\n",
      "Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations, the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member, therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.\n",
      "`` These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence.\n",
      "It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts.\n",
      "Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community, prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions''.\n",
      "Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point.\n",

      "Its editors only knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue.\n",
      "This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.\n",
      "As a result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central distribution.\n",
      "A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights.\n",
      "These have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and a host of others.\n",
      "In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally.\n",
      "It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming, to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one example.\n",
      "To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines.\n",
      "When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State.\n",
      "For the central storage, Tri-State buys one acre, Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece.\n",
      "In other words, the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State.\n",
      "It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least large enough to have a strong credit position.\n",
      "The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties.\n",
      "The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies.\n",
      "However, that is not all he has to do.\n",
      "He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating.\n",
      "For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor.\n",
      "The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low.\n",
      "The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected.\n",
      "The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer trucks in the residential streets.\n",
      "The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to their many regulations.\n",
      "There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil, an obvious precaution, since the account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.\n",
      "They are laid a minimum of 24'''' deep and in some areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking.\n",
      "Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons.\n",
      "Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.\n",
      "He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available.\n",
      "It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods, and that's an understatement.\n",
      "What does Tri-State actually want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for'' stage??\n",
      "It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years, with renewal options, to a strong oil company.\n",
      "This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers, for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully.\n",
      "But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights.\n",
      "It pays in the long( hot) run to take good care of the water works.\n",
      "First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.\n",
      "The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean.\n",
      "Of course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.\n",
      "If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard'' be sure to check it.\n",
      "Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years.\n",
      "Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer.\n",
      "The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption, reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.\n",
      "If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat.\n",
      "The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.\n",
      "There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.\n",
      "Be careful that you keep adequate coverage, but look for places to save money.\n",
      "For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.\n",
      "This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you.\n",
      "This applies to repair work of winter storage.\n",
      "Discounts run up to 2% of cost.\n",
      "Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan.\n",
      "In the period since the end of World War 2, -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field.\n",
      "The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of volume alone.\n",
      "Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries.\n",
      "and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons, medallions, etc., owes much to the field, as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics.\n",
      "There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below.\n",
      "The concept of trans-illumination( as shown by the photo on p. 92), as just one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved.\n",
      "According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales.\n",
      "Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction.\n",
      "Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs;;\n",
      "Currently, there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components.\n",
      "Why the trend to plastics??\n",
      "Plastics combine such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.\n",
      "According to one major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit.\n",
      "a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb., compared to 275-300 lb. for neon.\n",
      "They offer exceptional design freedom, making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer.\n",
      "Pre-decoration, low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry.\n",
      "Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs( generally 5000 units is the minimum) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs.\n",
      "Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding.\n",
      "What plastics to use??\n",
      "Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, and will not yellow.\n",
      "Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures, resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.\n",
      "New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color.\n",
      "Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign.\n",
      "The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former, constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within.\n",
      "The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required.\n",
      "Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another;;\n",
      "Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.\n",
      "It is believed that these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.\n",
      "Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces;;\n",
      "they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces.\n",
      "Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit.\n",
      "Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs.\n",
      "Signs are meant to convey a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters.\n",
      "Frequently, the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products, price changes, etc..\n",
      "The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them.\n",
      "The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters.\n",
      "Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains.\n",
      "For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends twisted behind the panels.\n",
      "Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material, which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.\n",
      "Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft., the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters.\n",
      "Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa, Calif..\n",
      "Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum, which may be mounted to various surfaces.\n",
      "Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width.\n",
      "Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways.\n",
      "Don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out\n",
      "It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place.\n",
      "Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Af through a narrow doorway.\n",
      "There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet.\n",
      "that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window.\n",
      "You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one, two, three order -- first the stud on one side, then the window, then the stud on the other side.\n",
      "Install your disappearing stair( or stairs) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling.\n",
      "New rule no. 3: rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you\n",
      "It makes it easy to handle much heavier units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside.\n",
      "It makes materials handling the only construction cost that( like earthmoving and roadbuilding) should be lower today than in 1929.\n",
      "It changes the answers to `` Who should do what, and where''??\n",
      "It changes the answers on when to do what at the site.\n",
      "Instead of closing the house in first( as most builders do) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to( see p 121).\n",
      "But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, roofing on the roof, etc..\n",
      "The revolution is well under way, but much more remains to be done\n",
      "`` Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads;;\n",
      "only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads;;\n",
      "only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.\n",
      "`` So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling( most of it inefficient) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing''.\n",
      "`` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost of materials handling.\n",
      "Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem''.\n",
      "Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized.\n",
      "There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it.\n",
      "Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need.\n",
      "an NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling.\n",
      "Of these, 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.\n",
      "Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer.\n",
      "`` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift, dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time'', says James Wright of Aj.\n",
      "These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 bd/ft( say 120,000 lb in a 50' box car) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars.\n",
      "First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 lb;;\n",
      "later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast( still pending elsewhere) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 lb.\n",
      "More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars, and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf.\n",
      "This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf, but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open.\n",
      "Says NRLDA's James Wright: `` Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment''.\n",
      "The reason: today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper.\n",
      "It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading.\n",
      "And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best spot( in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house), and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.\n",
      "Says Wright: `` Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years.\n",
      "Restudy what your men do, to help them waste less of the time you pay for\n",
      "Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right, so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.\n",
      "Even `` America's most efficient builder'', Bob Schmitt of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works.\n",
      "Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.\n",
      "Builder Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of NAHB, cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` SCR masonry process'' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less.\n",
      "A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick packages.\n",
      "The SCR process, with its precision corner-posts, its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day.\n",
      "One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew.\n",
      "Reports Jim Lendrum: `` By studying men on the job, we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three.\n",
      "We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams;;\n",
      "We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job, five men, not four, is the magic number''.\n",
      "No house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled.\n",
      "Don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud\n",
      "Green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum.\n",
      "But now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels, green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.\n",
      "There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone.\n",
      "Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the crowds and common happenstance.\n",
      "If you've travelled in Europe a time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic.\n",
      "Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new.\n",
      "However, after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles, and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market places.\n",
      "Time stands still as you climb the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags, their faces turned to the sea.\n",
      "And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean??\n",
      "An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.\n",
      "The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.\n",
      "It is that elemental.\n",
      "You can call one of the car rental services directly( Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines offer this service as well.\n",
      "The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all.\n",
      "For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to return home.\n",
      "If you plan to visit any of these countries, you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00.\n",
      "If you would feel happier with full collision insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance.\n",
      "It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon.\n",
      "With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation.\n",
      "There is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans.\n",
      "The investigation will be well worth your time.\n",
      "If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available, as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models.\n",
      "If you wish to budget closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries, one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon, seating six, at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer.\n",
      "If you will be using your car more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon.\n",
      "With six in the group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee.\n",
      "In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12.\n",
      "Rates for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models.\n",
      "If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month, it might be wise for you to lease a car.\n",
      "You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner, which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe.\n",
      "There is a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroen 2 CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu.\n",
      "There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan.\n",
      "For one thing, the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road.\n",
      "Still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car.\n",
      "The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car.\n",
      "It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.\n",
      "Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800.\n",
      "Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less, but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine.\n",
      "However, whether you arrange to have a European or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger.\n",
      "If you drive greater distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands.\n",
      "Of course, if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.\n"

      "Aside from the comico-romantico content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on.\n",
      "And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt, was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.\n",
      "In other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white.\n",
      "but consider, if you can bear it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo.\n",
      "This basic principle, the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith, Jr., at the University of Buffalo, where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.\n",
      "A brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind''.\n",
      "It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock'' they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication''.\n",
      "It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people.\n",
      "This, for obvious reasons, makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.\n",
      "In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished colleague, George Trager( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm), and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell( Ray), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication:( 1) words or language( 2) paralanguage, a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks, and `` tone'' of voice, and( 3) kinesics, the technical name for gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head, `` talking'' with one's hands, et cetera.\n",
      "For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.\n",
      "Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: Af Note the drop to pitch 1( the lowest) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence;;\n",
      "Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with: Af In other words, the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated.\n",
      "With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture.\n",
      "The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world.\n",
      "Some of the earliest recordings, made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts.\n",
      "In a general way, psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words.\n",
      "At a minimum, recording -- usually on tape, which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists.\n",
      "Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level.\n",
      "By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist.\n",
      "It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.\n",
      "Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist.\n",
      "His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient.\n",
      "aside from her specifically regional accent, she reveals by the use of the triad, `` irritable, tense, depressed'', a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language( i.e., she must have had at least a high-school education), and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before.\n",
      "Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody'', putting particular violence on `` everybody'', indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point.\n",
      "Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.\n",
      "He may then very well conclude that `` everybody'' is probably not the true target of her resentment.\n",
      "Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody'' truthfully refers to the woman's husband.\n",
      "so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce.\n",
      "By saying `` another emotional death'', she reveals that there has been a previous one, although she has not described it in words.\n",
      "The phrase, `` emotional death'', interesting and, to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative''.\n",
      "Since the psychiatric interview, like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience.\n",
      "His own communication apparatus operated superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman.\n",
      "Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques;;\n",
      "almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.\n",
      "Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;;\n",
      "to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen.\n",
      "On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody, as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person.\n",
      "The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used;;\n",
      "When someone says, for example, `` They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me'', it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made.\n",

      "If anyone thought of the John Harvey, it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried.\n",

      "Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander who would conduct the `` Little Blitz'' on London in 1944, a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously.\n",
      "More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector.\n",

      "And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns, and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on.\n",
      "After the first two were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's shot it out.\n",

      "Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when''.\n",
      "Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue( already seen) illusion, just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.\n",
      "When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance of deja vue, except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar.\n",
      "One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified.\n",
      "One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered, `` I want a word with you, please''.\n",
      "At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier.\n",
      "Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts.\n",
      "However, readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams, should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams, Chapter 1::\n",
      "As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case,, and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams''.\n",
      "The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities.\n",
      "I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence, so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen.\n",
      "And when psychology explains glibly, `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it'' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind.\n",

      "But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain??\n",
      "As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location.\n",
      "Hereby, the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.\n",

      "Dr. H. V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu,( 1300 B.C.) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht, was about to be published by him the following day.\n",
      "Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream.\n",
      "We may conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the dream priest, could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning.\n",
      "But, in denying any physical reality for this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or sudden substitution??\n",

      "So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York.\n",
      "Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients, the food does taste good.\n",
      "When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.\n",
      "These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen, grades four through eight.\n",
      "From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.\n",
      "The Director, Walter E. Clark, believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare.\n",
      "To him this means caring for the whole child, providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind.\n",
      "The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school.\n",
      "In a climate hostile to agriculture, Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques.\n",
      "Where a growing season may, with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor, sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail.\n",
      "Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.\n",
      "Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil.\n",
      "The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd and wastes of all kinds.\n",
      "Soon after the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this.\n",
      "To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth.\n",
      "Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby driveway and said, `` This soil used to be like that hard packed road over there''.\n",
      "`` People and soils respond slowly'', says Walter Clark, `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program.\n",
      "The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas, potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar.\n",
      "Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future.\n",
      "The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread.\n",
      "`` Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push''.\n",
      "Of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better.\n",
      "Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager.\n",
      "Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour.\n",
      "Once the grains are ground, vitamin E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week.\n",
      "It is well liked by the children and faculty.\n",
      "`` Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much'', said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds.\n",
      "The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was all they ever served.\n",
      "When the chance came, they first eliminated cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day.\n",
      "The school has received letters from parents asking, `` What happened to Johnny??\n",
      "He never used to like any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants.\n",
      "Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark, `` Lillian, did you put nuts in the bread today''??\n",
      "Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont.\n",
      "Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables.\n",
      "Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves.\n",
      "The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues.\n",
      "Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons.\n",
      "To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.\n",
      "On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail.\n",
      "They learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time.\n",
      "They tasted good to him, so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey.\n",
      "Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy.\n",
      "The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality.\n",
      "The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day.\n",
      "Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof.\n",
      "Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen.\n",
      "Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit.\n",
      "A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights.\n",
      "Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday, November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight.\n",
      "Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail.\n",
      "From Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent, N. Y..\n",
      "When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too.\n",
      "The question was `` Where to land''??\n",
      "Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` Jenny'' and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.\n",
      "The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions.\n",
      "The `` Barre Aviation Field'' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood.\n",
      "Though the makeshift airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule.\n",
      "It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air.\n",
      "They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the terminals.\n",
      "During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes.\n",
      "Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map.\n",
      "The ship was a Waco biplane, one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind.\n",
      "A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to compete in the `` On-to-Spokane'' Air Derby of 1927.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers.\n",
      "So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract.\n",
      "By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier.\n",
      "The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't.\n",
      "Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.\n",
      "Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.\n",
      "And besides you seem to make it all right here''.\n",
      "It took a tragedy to bring things to a head.\n",
      "After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field.\n",
      "Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt. Franklin Wolfe, badly injured.\n",
      "A long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable, they decided to use it.\n",
      "As a wind direction indicator, they tied a cotton rag to a sapling.\n",
      "During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department, asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip''.\n",
      "Since Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing temperature conditions.\n",
      "Over the weeks, America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.\n",
      "Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home.\n",
      "The airman's stock answer to `` Weren't you cold''??\n",
      "As daylight began to show through the frosty windows, Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature and wind-velocity readings.\n",
      "Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.\n",
      ") Wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding rain, snow and sleet in true postal tradition.\n",
      "Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead.\n",
      "Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his trips were completed.\n",
      "Often, threading through the overcast, he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad.\n",
      "When driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes.\n",
      "There he'd take a compass reading, figure his air speed, and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.\n",
      "At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.\n",
      "Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just time to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip.\n",
      "Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.\n",
      "Once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up.\n",
      "At a nod of his head they let go, turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream.\n",
      "How did I get to be sixty-five so fast??\n",
      "Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.\n",
      "never seemed as if it could happen to you;;\n",
      "only to the other fellow.\n",
      "How am I going to live??\n",
      "What am I going to do??\n",
      "You are conscientious, hard working, honest, accurate, a good penman, and a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.\n",
      "Everything must balance to the last penny.\n",
      "However, the last few years of your life, things seem to be changing.\n",
      "Your way doesn't seem to be so darned important any more.\n",
      "All sorts of plans come to life.\n",
      "Well, to get back to the problem of retirement.\n",
      "Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept what they have, and make the most of it( a wonderful gift to have, believe me) -- some see only darkness, the bitter side of everything.\n",
      "You've got to learn to live with it.\n",
      "The question is `` How are you going to live with it''??\n",
      "It seems to me, the first thing you've got to do, to be happy, is to face up to your problems, no matter what they may be.\n",
      "Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life.\n",
      "You've got to do something.\n",
      "There are many, many things to do.\n",
      "Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.\n",
      "If you can't think of a thing to do, try something -- anything.\n",
      "Maybe you are not that gifted either, but how about puttering around with the old paints??\n",
      "Do you like to sew??\n",
      "Do you love to run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes??\n",
      "If you do, go to it.\n",
      "When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on, or get out the safety pins.\n",
      "Then again, there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs.\n",
      "Some people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time.\n",
      "Do you yearn to make cakes and pies, or special cookies and candies??\n",
      "There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy, in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary.\n",
      "Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood??\n",
      "They love to dust, scrub, polish, wax floors, move the furniture around from place to place, take down the curtains, put up new ones and have themselves a real ball.\n",
      "Perhaps you would like to become a writer.\n",
      "Ever since I was a child, I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing.\n",
      "If you do decide to write, you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection.\n",
      "But, it could happen, and it may happen to you.\n",
      "You say, `` But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby.\n",
      "I haven't got that kind of money''.\n",
      "It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free.\n",
      "Also, there's scrap books, collecting newspaper pictures and clippings, or any items of interest to you.\n",
      "It's getting interested in something that counts.\n",
      "As for me, I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles( I love puzzles) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands.\n",
      "I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now.\n",
      "So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise you to make the most of each day, enjoy each one to the n'th degree.\n",
      "Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet.\n",
      "What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing frequency these days??\n",
      "When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual.\n",
      "`` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power''.\n",
      "Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.\n",
      "All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their own.\n",
      "An animal, bird or insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie.\n",
      "This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms.\n"

      "As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.\n",
      "This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act.\n",
      "This is obvious when it is remembered that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby.\n",
      "The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control.\n",
      "That is, when first penetration takes place, the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain.\n",
      "By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape.\n",
      "She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object.\n",

      "These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse.\n",
      "They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina;;\n",
      "In fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.\n",
      "Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.\n",
      "The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all.\n",
      "Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride, both physically and psychologically.\n",
      "The insistent, forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen.\n",
      "The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it.\n",
      "Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation.\n",
      "The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire.\n",
      "The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax.\n",
      "Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period.\n",
      "The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them.\n",
      "The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again.\n",
      "This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered.\n",
      "He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.\n",
      "The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman.\n",
      "Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment.\n",
      "Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid.\n",
      "It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves''.\n",
      "Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated by the nude form.\n",
      "Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.\n",
      "Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.\n",
      "Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked'', while another woman, boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free, natural nude life -- for most of that period''.\n",
      "The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic, a threat and danger'' to all the young, or good, or religious, or moral persons.\n",
      "One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected.\n",
      "I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean, healthful, free way of natural life in nudism'', who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit.\n",
      "The partners each bring to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.\n",
      "But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved.\n",
      "But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed.\n",
      "It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband.\n",
      "The whole act is tailored to her pleasure, and not to theirs.\n",
      "Beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that.\n",
      "But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.\n",
      "It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role.\n",
      "A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too''.\n",
      "Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous.\n",
      "And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.\n",
      "He is a target of ridicule to his wife, and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well.\n",
      "`` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness'', declares Dr. Calderone.\n",
      "`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower'', Dr. Linden says, `` the effects on their whole relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous''.\n",
      "In one extreme case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded.\n",
      "To win her favors, her husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle from his employer.\n",
      "Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison.\n",
      "Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them.\n",
      "One wife, described by a New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties.\n",
      "The wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage.\n",
      "She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.\n",
      "Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage.\n",
      "Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area.\n",
      "More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home.\n",
      "Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives.\n",
      "The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job.\n",
      "`` The pattern'', says Dr. Morton Schillinger, psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy, `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night''.\n",
      "No one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world.\n",
      "There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom.\n",
      "They like to be dominated.\n",
      "One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor.\n",
      "Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept.\n",
      "Family survival on our own Western frontier, for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon;;\n",
      "`` Grandma wasn't expected to like it'', Dr. Marion Hilliard, the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the'90s.\n",
      "When did women begin to assert themselves sexually??\n",
      "Some date it from woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin.\n",
      "Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs.\n",
      "She liked this taste of authority and independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.\n",
      "`` Very few wives'', says Dr. Calderone, `` who balance the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.\n",
      "A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well''.\n",
      "And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.\n",
      "Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax.\n",
      "They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response.\n",
      "In fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher, Dr. Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior'' to men.\n",
      "According to Dr. Ellis, the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, Dr. Ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.\n",
      "Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr. Maurice Linden, many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them.\n",
      "An aggressive woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under.\n",
      "Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction''.\n",
      "But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity.\n",
      "Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.\n",
      "If his on-the-job problems work out, he may return to his old pattern.\n",
      "On the other hand, a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.\n",
      "Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.\n",
      "`` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little difference if one or the other dominates'', Dr. Calderone declares.\n",
      "`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment''.\n",
      "Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage.\n",
      "Too many husbands, Dr. Schillinger continues, worry about `` how well they're doing'', and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play.\n",
      "Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men, there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor.\n",
      "She never hid the fact that she liked to play.\n",
      "Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial''.\n",
      "It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot( Mickey) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.\n",
      "She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington, a name that made some of the gossip columns.\n",
      "It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best.\n",
      "Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge:\n",
      "In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him.\n",
      "She lied in order to get it.\n",
      "`` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke''.\n",
      "Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.\n",
      "I never gave that boy a cent.\n",
      "During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.\n",
      "But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends''.\n",
      "She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a `` sponsor'' instead of a chaperone.\n",
      "She had talked her `` boy friend'' into sending her to New York to take a screen test.\n",
      "She quickly moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business.\n",
      "She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke.\n",
      "An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield, the famous producer''.\n",
      "The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.\n",
      "`` I'd love to audition for you'', she gushed.\n",
      "She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance.\n",
      "After a few minutes he said, `` I can't use you if you dance like that.\n",
      "I'd like to see you dance nude''.\n",
      "Diane loved to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.\n",
      "When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door, she would tell him, `` If you go home now, I'll scream''.\n",
      "More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.\n",
      "One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel.\n",
      "She wanted to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.\n",
      "`` Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers''.\n",
      "The Greek evidently fell for her, `` Monsieur X'' recounted, and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs( about $300) and led her to the roulette tables.\n",
      "She could do no wrong at the tables that time.\n",
      "Smarter than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag and took the night train to Paris.\n",
      "No one ever learned what happened to the Greek.\n",
      "The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, the George 5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed it to Rome.\n",
      "She teamed up with another beauty, whose name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious.\n",
      "`` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent.\n",
      "The hotel staff, as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.\n",
      "They were asked to leave the hotel.\n",
      "`` You can't do this to us'', Diane screamed.\n",
      "With the Ambassador as headquarters, she continued to promote good will abroad.\n",
      "Of course, her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a limit to what one person can do.\n",
      "She thought royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome, she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.\n",
      "She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.\n",
      "`` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him'', the friend continued.\n",
      "No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.\n",
      "Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key.\n",
      "She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her.\n",
      "`` So extensive became her circle of admirers'', Egyptian police said, `` that her escapades caused distrust''.\n",
      "The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down.\n",
      "The cagey Pulley Bey, who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the country without his approval.\n",
      "Officials provided a temporary passport, good only for return to the United States.\n",
      "And return to the United States she did, into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office.\n",
      "Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.\n",
      "It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian restaurant.\n",
      "Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.\n",
      "It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington''.\n",
      "She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved to Bolivia.\n",
      "Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.\n",
      "He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time.\n",
      "Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and drugs killed her.\n",
      "`` I think that maybe she wanted it this way'', a vice squad cop said.\n",
      "`` A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date.\n",
      "She was on the junk, and they slide fast when that happens.\n",

      "`` Doctor'' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes.\n",
      "( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it.\n",
      "As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.\n",
      "Did she know, he asked, why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health??\n",
      "For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue.\n",
      "Continuing glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:\n",
      "But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about.\n",
      "Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body''.\n",
      "He urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300.\n",
      "When she said that she didn't have the money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one.\n",
      "He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment, a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again'', and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.\n",
      "Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day.\n",
      "After another treatment with the machine, he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts''.\n",
      "He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine.\n",
      "When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules, Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain.\n",
      "Leaving Lee's office, Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated her for burned tissue.\n",
      "Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines.\n",
      "Rather, it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.\n",
      "With these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age.\n",
      "He milks the latest scientific advances, translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer.\n",
      "The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 -- anything the traffic will bear.\n",
      "According to the Food And Drug Administration( FDA), `` Doctor'' Ghadiali, Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique, and Dr. Wilhelm Reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000, 5000, and 2000 fake health machines.\n",
      "Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business.\n",
      "Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to a masseur, and Mr. A., a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast'' and the `` diagnometer''.\n",
      "Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually.\n",
      "That's why the FDA, the American Medical Association( AMA), and the National Better Business Bureau( BBB) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually.\n",
      "The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history.\n",
      "Similarly, the American Cancer Society( ACS), the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high.\n",
      "Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer.\n",
      "In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative.\n",
      "The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important, of course.\n",
      "But it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.\n",
      "By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate, by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.\n",
      "Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her.\n",
      "As a result, she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor'' was using were phony.\n",
      "She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized.\n",
      "Mr. A., her fellow townsman, also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple sclerosis -- and himself.\n",
      "`` That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose'', he says today.\n",
      "`` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments''.\n",
      "And there was the case of Tom Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine.\n",
      "After his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung.\n",
      "Yes, Tom caught it in time to stay alive.\n",

      "When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77), one of his victims was not around to testify: He was dead of cancer.\n",

      "People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks''.\n",

      "A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion.\n",

      "The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system.\n",
      "In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed, yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy.\n",
      "Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw;;\n",
      "they are not anchored directly to the bone.\n",
      "On her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays, photographs, tooth measurements, and `` tooth prints'' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.\n",
      "If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs.\n",
      "`` If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place'', explains Dr. Brodie.\n",
      "Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.\n",
      "When in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered.\n",
      "During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.\n",
      "But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place.\n",
      "Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth.\n",
      "Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.\n",
      "Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months.\n",
      "An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct.\n",
      "Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago.\n",
      "An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.\n",
      "To become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist.\n",
      "`` Costs may seem high, but they used to be even higher'', says Dr. Brodie.\n",
      "`` Fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago''.\n",
      "Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years.\n",
      "`` In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at;;\n",
      "now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent'', he says.\n",
      "`` Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that helps us know what we can do''.\n",
      "In the past an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, would never accommodate them.\n",
      "That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their child have orthodontic work done too early.\n",
      "`` Both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions, some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so.\n",
      "Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment'', he urges.\n",
      "Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money.\n",
      "Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has been replaced by alginates( gelatin-like material) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.\n",
      "as a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started, the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.\n",
      "`` After your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first dental appointment'', Dr. Brodie advises.\n",
      "`` Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year''.\n",
      "In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.\n",
      "From time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him'', who were `` on the other side'', and reports what they are saying.\n",
      "After a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames.\n",
      "As the hour progresses, the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements.\n",
      "In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception( ESP), on this side of the `` veil''.\n",
      "However that may be, people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons.\n",
      "Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased, or seek indications for future plans.\n",
      "The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions, instead of talking with a `` control'' who speaks through an entranced sensitive.\n",
      "Many a sitter( in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind.\n",
      "it had been latent, unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him!!\n",
      "Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious'' moods and to clarify them.\n",
      "However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium, he did not receive a personal reading.\n",
      "For this was to be a `` proxy sitting''.\n",
      "As was noted earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive.\n",
      "He remarked: `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter''.\n",
      "The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central characters in this drama must be separated.\n",
      "One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings'', wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute, the proxy sitter.\n",
      "All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions.\n",
      "Here the absent sitter makes a `` date'' with a communicator( someone close to him who is deceased), asking him to `` come in'' at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for him.\n",
      "He gives this to the medium at the appointed time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator.\n",
      "As always, a tape recording or detailed notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.\n",
      "It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range.\n",
      "Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him.\n",
      "Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved, for it is recognized how `` elastic'' these readings can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.\n",
      "If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you, even when you were not in the picture at all!!\n",
      "An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit'', describing something accurately for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances??\n",
      "It is, of course, easy to see how `` J'' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another.\n",
      "`` A journey'', `` a little white house'', `` a change of outlook'', can apply to many people.\n",
      "And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal.\n",
      "One sitter may think `` a leather couch'' identifies a reading as surely directed to him;;\n",
      "to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase, `` Atta boy''!!\n",
      "To get around this quite difficult corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him.\n",
      "If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame: `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life??\n",
      "Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody, and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience''??\n",
      "Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following, which, if they turned out to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:\n",
      "Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road.\n",
      "Methods have been developed of assigning `` weights'' to statements;;\n",
      "that is, it is known empirically that names beginning with R are more common than those beginning with Z;;\n",
      "that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth;;\n",
      "that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox.\n",
      "Various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities'' against which to measure the readings.\n",
      "In the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment, readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements.\n",
      "It is very important indeed, in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis, to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.\n",
      "Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody??\n",
      "That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.\n",
      "So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time are mailed, and the distant sitter( whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium) must mark each little item as Correct( Hit), Incorrect( Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant( applying to him and, he feels, not to anyone else).\n",
      "He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.\n",
      "Conversely, if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.\n",
      "In another approach to the same procedure, the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements.\n",
      "It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her `` hits''.\n",
      "Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream'', where the sensitive is at her best.\n",
      "Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses.\n",
      "Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: `` There's such a noise of loud machinery'', or `` I hear a child crying'', or `` He says we're all here and glad to see you''.\n",
      "Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view: `` a house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door''.\n",
      "The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively feels emotions.\n",
      "Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually there.\n",
      "If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost as if she were physically going closer.\n",
      "If asked how she gets her impressions, she probably can only say that she `` just gets them'' -- some more vividly than others.\n",
      "Of course, there is an element of training here: these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance, have learned to develop their power.\n",
      "Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery.\n",
      "It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium has to translate these into meaning.\n",
      "But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail;;\n",
      "taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement.\n",
      "Though they are often heard clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name `` Hill'', for instance.\n",
      "One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter.\n",
      "The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock.\n",
      "He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice;;\n",
      "No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.\n",
      "It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably.\n",
      "The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis.\n",
      "A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer.\n",
      "It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment.\n",
      "He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations, such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his turn.\n",
      "There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job.\n",
      "If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free of mortgage, there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of.\n",

      "The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability.\n",
      "Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost, provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs.\n",
      "For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income.\n",
      "It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health.\n",
      "Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14.\n",
      "Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs.\n",
      "If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll need more land.\n",
      "In deciding how much land you want, take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.\n",
      "When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm.\n",
      "If you have a year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help.\n",
      "In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor, compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.\n",
      "List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.\n",
      "You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one.\n",
      "Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work.\n",
      "If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only hand tools.\n",
      "You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing, however.\n",
      "If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor( available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices).\n",
      "These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.\n",
      "Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer.\n",
      "If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises.\n",
      "You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs.\n",
      "If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig, a combine, or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.\n",
      "Before you look for a farm you'll need to know( 1) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake;;\n",
      "and( 2) whether you want to buy or rent.\n",
      "Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.\n",
      "If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy.\n",
      "Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.\n",
      "nearness to work.\n",
      "Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm.\n",
      "The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.\n",
      "Nearness to markets.\n",
      "If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.\n",
      "If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example, you should be close to a town or city.\n",
      "There are slums in the country as well as in the city.\n",
      "A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value.\n",
      "Check on the schools in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation to and from them.\n",
      "You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them.\n",
      "If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled.\n",
      "Pond water can be filtered for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble.\n",
      "Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise??\n",
      "Small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop.\n",
      "How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating??\n",
      "The value of the farm to you will depend on --\n",
      "Its worth as a place to live.\n",
      "Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town.\n",
      "Take into account the difference in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and the cost of travel to work.\n",
      "List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year.\n",
      "Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family.\n",
      "It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth, but charge something for it.\n",
      "To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way.\n",
      "Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge.\n",
      "For almost two months, the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents, babies, starved, beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned, gassed, burned.\n",
      "One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers.\n",
      "Public relations strategists everywhere, watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their neighbors, studying interviews with men and women on the street, cried out: Too much, too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors are losing their effect.\n",
      "And still another witness, one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses, had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot.\n",
      "Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs.\n",
      "Counsel for the defense, however, shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections, rarely raised an objection.\n",
      "Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming, if not exhausting, effect likely to improve his client's chances??\n",
      "Interruptions came largely from the bench, which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious effort to choke off the flow.\n",
      "These trials were properly termed `` political cases'' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences.\n",
      "The Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.\n",
      "It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection, and of refining the recollection, that will last as long as there are Jews.\n",
      "`` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial'' -- said Ben Gurion, `` and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history''.\n",
      "How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism??\n",
      "And if it was not an individual who was in the dock, why was the Trial, as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend''??\n",
      "It might be contended, of course, that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.\n",
      "In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument.\n",
      "One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages.\n",
      "Shout at Eichmann though he might, the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism.\n",
      "Yes, he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich'', and such a belief is, of course, typical of `` patriotic'' anti-Semites;;\n",
      "The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself.\n",
      "In regard to Eichmann, it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent.\n",
      "Not through fear of disobeying orders, as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous the better, `` Well, let's try it''.\n",
      "At any rate, the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS, and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent.\n",
      "But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it.\n",
      "If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary??\n",
      "The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs.\n",
      "Heydrich, in opening the Conference, followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to'' previous `` solutions'' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence, economic strangulation, forced emigration, and evacuation.\n",
      "In other words, the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as a readiness for murder.\n",
      "This, in fact, it turned out to be.\n",
      "Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions, and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes;;\n",
      "whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.\n",
      "What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute??\n",
      "The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others.\n",
      "Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere'' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings??\n",
      "The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism'' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed''.\n",
      "But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press seems to have missed it.\n",
      "Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis, both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states.\n",
      "Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon.\n",
      "Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors.\n",
      "Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes??\n",
      "clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness;;\n",
      "once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him.\n",
      "Finally, if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e., Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, France??\n",
      "Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports??\n",
      "As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence).\n",
      "It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe.\n",
      "It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable;;\n",
      "most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors' accounts.\n",
      "In Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.\n",
      "In New York City in 1958, the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device.\n",
      "He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.\n",
      "Immediately, the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.\n",
      "These incidents, typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue.\n",
      "It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries.\n",
      "Where it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.\n"

      "The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation.\n",
      "Instead of emotional recrimination, loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached.\n",
      "`` All too frequently'', points out James O'Gara, managing editor of Commonweal, `` Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades''.\n",
      "The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between Catholics and Non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning.\n",
      "Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring, as many Non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed.\n",
      "Family planning is encouraged, so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring.\n",
      "Pope Pius 12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and social `` indications''.\n",
      "This means that such factors as the health of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.\n",
      "Catholics, Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used.\n",
      "The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author: It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them.\n",
      "The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end.\n",
      "This conclusion is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given'' physical arrangements.\n",
      "Thus, man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation, the propagation of the race.\n",
      "Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.\n",
      "Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable.\n",
      "Why is it so different in regard to birth control??\n",
      "It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief, or at least the practical consequences thereof, upon others.\n",
      "It is always a temptation for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others.\n",
      "Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past.\n",
      "Consider what happened during World War 1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress.\n",
      "Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful.\n",
      "With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens.\n",
      "The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history.\n",
      "The so-called `` noble experiment'' came to an inglorious end.\n",
      "That tumultuous, painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.\n",
      "That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today.\n",
      "Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary to divine law.\n",
      "Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction.\n",
      "The various Lambeth Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally.\n",
      "Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference declared: `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage.\n",
      "In 1930, the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, contraception might be morally legitimate.\n",
      "`` As to the necessity'', the committee declared, `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control of conception, there can be no question.\n",
      "There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right''.\n",
      "Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared it at times to be a religious duty.\n",
      "What determines the morality, they state, is not the means used, but the motive In general, the means( excluding abortion) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical.\n",
      "It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives.\n",
      "The general board declared: `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right.\n",
      "The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception''.\n",
      "An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive religious duty.\n",
      "Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control.\n",
      "To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.\n",
      "This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion: They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.\n",
      "Only confusion, failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin.\n",
      "On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, Discovery, weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool, London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea.\n",

      "What happened to the fourteen missing men??\n",
      "But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information.\n",
      "Not enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage.\n",
      "First, they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma.\n",
      "Second, they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great American river, and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas.\n",
      "This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able -- or ever, probably, will be able -- to determine:\n",
      "Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East.\n",
      "In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia.\n",
      "This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America.\n",
      "The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.\n",
      "He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth.\n",
      "A century of exploration had established that a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe and the Indies.\n",
      "One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded.\n",
      "But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to the north.\n",
      "( Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.\n",
      "In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back.\n",
      "Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.\n",
      "Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames.\n",
      "On previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.\n",
      "On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case.\n",
      "On the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic.\n",
      "The mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the Half Moon, was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or desert at any opportunity.\n",
      "Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis.\n",
      "But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find.\n",
      "Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer.\n",
      "And he refused to be anything else.\n",
      "It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships.\n",
      "( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.\n",
      ") In 1610, Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.\n",
      "Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames.\n",
      "Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps, panders and whores.\n",
      "He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the Discovery picked him up.\n",
      "The issue was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England.\n",
      "With difficulty, Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.\n",
      "Floating ice bore down from the north and west.\n",
      "As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the Great Strait.\n",
      "After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway -- and the crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.\n",
      "For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd.\n",
      "A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther.\n",
      "Instead of quelling the dissension, as many captains of the era would have done( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.\n",
      "He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which he set up in view of the crew.\n",
      "When Hudson had finished, the `` town meeting'' broke down into a general, wordy argument.\n",
      "One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety of them to be back in England.\n",
      "Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home.\n",
      "Hudson was free to sail on.\n",
      "To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet.\n",
      "Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea( now called Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific.\n",
      "The great `` sea to the westwards'' was a dead end.\n",
      "For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North American continent.\n",
      "This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure.\n",
      "Feverishly, he tried to brush away this intuition.\n",
      "North and south, east and west, back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after week.\n",
      "Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England through the `` Furious Overfall'' was again filling with ice.\n",
      "Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty.\n",
      "Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial.\n",
      "Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins.\n",
      "Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward.\n",
      "There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.\n",
      "The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.\n",
      "The anchor cable would have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe.\n",
      "Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands, conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North.\n",
      "Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies.\n",
      "Having achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers.\n",
      "The grant, which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay.\n",
      "Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier.\n",
      "The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815.\n",
      "Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire.\n",
      "The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818.\n",
      "It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward.\n",
      "When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river.\n",
      "The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food.\n",
      "On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces.\n",
      "His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts.\n",
      "In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts'' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack.\n",
      "It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States.\n",
      "In September 1817 at Fort Daer( Pembina) Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux, he escorted to Prairie Du Chien.\n",
      "During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England.\n",
      "Upon arriving at Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois Territories''.\n",
      "With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River( present-day Minnesota river) their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse, and down the Red.\n",
      "This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk Ab1,040.\n",
      "Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food.\n",
      "Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.\n",
      "Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien, until then the most advanced United States post.\n",
      "It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good.\n",
      "Hercules L. Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien, contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers.\n",
      "Bailly, after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country'' and reached Fort Garry, as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the fall.\n",
      "Observing their distressing condition, Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation.\n",
      "As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise.\n",
      "Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.\n",
      "Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such `` sundry articles'' to a value of Ab4,500.\n",
      "As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory.\n",
      "Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating the timber to `` the Forks'' in rafts.\n",
      "`` I have done everything'', he wrote, `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment.\n",
      "'' Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350 persons stayed in the village.\n",
      "They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at `` great expense as well as danger''.\n",
      "At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling.\n",
      "The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave.\n",
      "After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick.\n",
      "In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June.\n",
      "On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi.\n",
      "By fall, 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis, with a few going as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United States.\n",
      "The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission, St. Paul, was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River.\n",
      "While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate.\n",
      "Accordingly, though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade.\n",
      "The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs.\n",
      "To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men.\n",
      "With their customary source of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country.\n",
      "Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks'' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells, transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement.\n",
      "This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.\n",
      "The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.\n",
      "Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray.\n",
      "A Confederate observed that the Yankees were: `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier''.\n",

      "Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age.\n",
      "Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, name one of them `` Fall-in'' and the other `` Close-up'', and then shoot them both, `` and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up''.\n",

      "A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia: `` dear Pa.\n",
      "We got to one house where there were five secessionists.\n",
      "They brok& run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them.\n",
      "A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear''.\n",
      "His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps.\n",
      "Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader.\n",
      "But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command''.\n",
      "Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.\n",
      "A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks.\n",
      "Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: `` I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago''.\n",
      "Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: `` I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against( the other half)''.\n",
      "Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk: `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment.\n",
      "I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than( by) Union quackery''.\n",
      "The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred.\n",
      "The Rebs were, to a Massachusetts corporal, `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey& gunpowder put into a human frame''.\n",
      "A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw.\n",
      "They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all'''.\n",
      "In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: `` you know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe, by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is Booty.\n",
      "The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America.\n",
      "And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world.\n",
      "Thus, if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.\n",
      "Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence.\n",
      "1) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions.\n",
      "Its folklore and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to become a cohesive force for national identification.\n",
      "One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years.\n",
      "Nor is it an accident that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years, has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature, American civilization, American anything have swept our school and college curricula.\n",
      "It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine.\n",
      "After all, the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.\n",
      "A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land.\n",
      "But we must never forget, most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs, almost always with conscious aims and ends.\n",
      "1) Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all.\n",
      "2) The concept that an `` American national folklore'' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.\n",
      "Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission.\n",
      "It has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, rhymes and such literary forms of expression.\n",
      "Related to written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence.\n",
      "In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this.\n",
      "Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material.\n",
      "Naturally, such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore.\n",
      "That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant.\n",
      "As long as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic'' to his audience, he remains satisfied.\n",
      "From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore.\n"

      "On the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic, regional and occupational groups that make up this nation.\n",
      "On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic, `` frontier western'' or colonial material willy-nilly.\n",
      "Unfortunately, few of the artists( writers, movie producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways.\n",
      "After all, the field is large, difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.\n",
      "For that matter, the experts themselves are a mixed breed.\n",
      "Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain as such.\n",
      "The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.\n",
      "he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream'' reasons that many persons hunt game;;\n",
      "Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector, are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material.\n",
      "Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found.\n",
      "The commercial propagandist, who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine.\n",
      "His standards are, of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst.\n",
      "Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although he cannot deny his debt to the collector.\n",
      "The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors.\n",
      "Publishers want books that will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint, but moral, material.\n",
      "The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in.\n",
      "And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone.\n",
      "If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public.\n",
      "And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each.\n",
      "When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure??\n",
      "Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was??\n",
      "Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be??\n",
      "When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged.\n",
      "In the first place, a good many writers who are said to use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale.\n",
      "In the second place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk writers'' of one sort or another, clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.\n",
      "Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection, as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People, Yes.\n",
      "The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass.\n",
      "The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude.\n",
      "In fact, there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional, ethnic and occupational limits.\n",
      "Nevertheless, with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days'' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk.\n",
      "The coalition was to prove inadvisable.\n",
      "He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body.\n",
      "The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.\n",
      "he divided humanity into `` right guys'' and `` wrong guys'', and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under.\n",
      "He walked with a heavy list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other, but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.\n",
      "Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly'' but he was, in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath.\n",
      "He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien.\n",
      "The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;;\n",
      "At the age of ten, when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg.\n",
      "He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors.\n",
      "He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.\n",
      "O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary;;\n",
      "But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.\n",
      "On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building;;\n",
      "the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000 in bribes, it was estimated.\n",
      "He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.\n",
      "Unlike the Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution.\n",
      "He was also personally active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state: `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements''.\n",
      "There was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time: Q. `` Who'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards''??\n",
      "But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans.\n",
      "Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the proprieter of a Loop gambling house.\n",
      "There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip.\n",
      "This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians, which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, `` had been maintained with more or less stealth'', but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts'', at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, openly, in the big downtown hotels''.\n",
      "Pasley continued: `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29''.\n",
      "O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal.\n",
      "He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness.\n",
      "They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as, when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey, a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion, Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest.\n",
      "To settle this slight, O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy.\n",
      "That sort of braggadocio, for that sort of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.\n",
      "A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through.\n",
      "Why, I can get them knocked off for half that much''.\n",
      "Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen.\n",
      "But in the meantime the beer-runner, unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message: `` Say, Dionie, I just been talking to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred.\n",
      "But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman.\n",
      "For three years, since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing.\n",
      "When, as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election, Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month.\n",
      "In six months O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb.\n",
      "At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still, and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession.\n",
      "it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco.\n",
      "Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times.\n",
      "Indeed, a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.\n",
      "In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea;;\n",
      "An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific.\n",
      "But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest.\n",
      "Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
      "Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.\n",
      "Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest.\n",
      "Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights.\n",
      "The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.\n",
      "They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.\n",
      "Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell, not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.\n",
      "At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.\n",
      "After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground.\n",
      "When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach, fearing that they might be buried under landslides.\n",
      "The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more( because of their great length), and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over.\n",
      "Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest.\n",
      "He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves.\n",
      "The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest.\n",
      "In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high.\n",
      "The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea.\n",
      "Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs;;\n",
      "the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance.\n",
      "The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet.\n",
      "But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.\n",
      "This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress.\n",
      "The moment the alarm goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which is the center of the warning system.\n",
      "By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific.\n",
      "All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system, and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly.\n",
      "At 17:07 that afternoon( Greenwich time) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu.\n",
      "While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.\n",
      "It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946.\n",
      "They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows.\n",
      "There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.\n",
      "But it is plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough.\n",
      "In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.\n",
      "The key to the world of geology is change;;\n",
      "Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man.\n",
      "Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated, but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them.\n",
      "Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.\n",
      "These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.\n",
      "( 1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface rocks do.\n",
      "In the search for oil and gas, we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources.\n",
      "Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history, or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name.\n",
      "Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables.\n",
      "But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a saloon on Saturday night.\n",
      "The truth is, however, that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil.\n",
      "Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it.\n",
      "Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces.\n",
      "First of all, no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper.\n",
      "Second, if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's on maneuvers.\n",
      "He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history and literature as well.\n",
      "Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army.\n",
      "For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn.\n",
      "It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop Aj.\n",
      "But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop and the regiment.\n",
      "Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them.\n",
      "But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, `` Garryowen''.\n",
      "It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march.\n",
      "In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen.\n",
      "The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children.\n",
      "It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment.\n",
      "He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment.\n",
      "One of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop.\n",
      "Carroll was sharp and military, but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth, and he wanted to play it cool.\n",
      "So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold a short time before.\n",
      "When the Korean war began, on June 25, 1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition.\n",
      "One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps.\n",
      "Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear.\n",
      "Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength.\n",
      "He assembled a group of 25 men, composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill.\n",
      "Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.\n",
      "The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire.\n",
      "Chandler, looking to right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran.\n",
      "Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again.\n",
      "He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire.\n",
      "Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, seeking a soft spot.\n",
      "They found it at the junction between Troops H and G, and prepared to counterattack.\n",
      "He turned to his platoon.\n",
      "Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward, `` Garryowen''!!\n",
      "For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that their lieutenant, the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead.\n",
      "That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun.\n",
      "Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon.\n",
      "Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds.\n",
      "Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived.\n",
      "So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.\n",
      "For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment.\n",
      "From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno.\n",
      "Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him.\n",
      "But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.\n",
      "Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by then.\n",
      "Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and, like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence, Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.\n",
      "I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in the sense that everyone agrees with them.\n",
      "If they were, Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about.\n",
      "I do mean, however, that I take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions.\n",
      "The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity;;\n",
      "and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States.\n",
      "I speak of `` the largest possible measure'' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around.\n",
      "This is true for two reasons: because Communism is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions;;\n",
      "and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization.\n",
      "It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal of American policy.\n",
      "Proximate in the sense that there are more distant, more `` positive'' ends we seek, to which victory over Communism is but a means.\n",
      "But dominant in the sense that every other objective, no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it.\n",
      "but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed.\n",
      "but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West, then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer.\n",
      "but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made.\n",
      "It may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism;;\n",
      "my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of Soviet Communist power.\n",
      "This much having been said, the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and, if so, how those resources ought to be used.\n",
      "This brings us squarely to the problem of power, and the uses a nation makes of power.\n",
      "I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that it always has been, that it always will be.\n",
      "And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.\n",
      "In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus.\n",
      "The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power.\n",
      "I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention.\n",
      "You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth.\n",
      "Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we were in the Soviets' position: `` There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean.\n",
      "Half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people''.\n",
      "Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.\n",
      "Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.\n",
      "If we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or, at least, of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage.\n",
      "The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years.\n",
      "The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.\n",
      "and even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading.\n",
      "Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill.\n",
      "But contrary to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important for its own sake.\n",
      "Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be.\n",
      "The thing to lose sleep over is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are likely to do about it.\n",
      "The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead.\n",
      "but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side.\n",
      "To the extent, then, that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation, there is reason for concern.\n",
      "And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be??\n",
      "In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded: the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests.\n",
      "Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level.\n",
      "The Soviets understand, moreover, that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West.\n",
      "Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize'' a country.\n",
      "The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist'', while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy.\n",
      "The Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist'' mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office.\n",
      "Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West.\n",
      "Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel;;\n",
      "Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination: the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West.\n"

      "They discovered that, although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction.\n",
      "The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows: to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent;;\n",
      "to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent;;\n",
      "However, they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way''.\n",
      "One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews: `` It's the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards''.\n",
      "The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds.\n",
      "`` We were brought up that way'' was one statement which won general assent.\n",
      "`` I want to show respect for my parents' religion'' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism.\n",
      "Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons, since I'll be living in a suburb''.\n",
      "Intermarriage, which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.\n",
      "`` When you marry, you want to have things in common'', a girl said, `` and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background''.\n",
      "A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious.\n",
      "It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food.\n",
      "One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.\n",
      "In their first two years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams.\n",
      "It is significant, too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts.\n",
      "The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys.\n",
      "The motivations for both sexes, to be sure, are different.\n",
      "The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed.\n",
      "One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women.\n",
      "It is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.\n",
      "In upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality.\n",
      "`` People automatically assume that I'm in college'', a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably.\n",
      "However, among the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college.\n",
      "The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and, buttressed by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student.\n",
      "She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature.\n",
      "One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost.\n",
      "What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts, they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world.\n",
      "There is, to begin, an important sex difference.\n",
      "Typically, in a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will attend the local college.\n",
      "Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home.\n",
      "The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.\n",
      "One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.\n",
      "They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status, the out-of-town school.\n",
      "At the same time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates.\n",
      "`` You don't have to watch what you say.\n",
      "Of course, I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there''.\n",
      "Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.\n",
      "And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping.\n",
      "Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting.\n",
      "The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field.\n",
      "Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours.\n",
      "This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.\n",
      "It is significant that the Catskills, which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day camps.\n",
      "But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, Long Island, for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish.\n",
      "In general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith.\n",
      "And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years.\n",
      "There are hordes of nubile young women there who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry.\n",
      "It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate.\n",
      "And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities, and houses( in the House Plan Association) that have good news to impart.\n",
      "`` Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House''.\n",
      "The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy way.\n",
      "The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes.\n",

      "Bruises, burns, cuts, etc., occurred frequently on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too.\n",
      "( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain.\n",
      "Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water;;\n",
      "`` Butter salve'' or `` butter ointment'' was used for burns, and for bruises as well.\n",
      "This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;;\n",
      "A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings, which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat''.\n",
      "To stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds.\n",

      "Until quite recently, `` sterile'' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound;;\n",
      "they would feed on its surface, leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.\n",
      "In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the family for 200 years.\n",
      "Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds, then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.\n",
      "While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had little variation.\n",

      "to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore.\n",
      "Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed;;\n",
      "For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth.\n",
      "Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead.\n",
      "Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus, used as well for chilblains.\n",
      "Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.\n",
      "This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.\n",
      "Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days.\n",
      "wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did just that.\n",
      "One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.\n",
      "Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie it on the wart, and wear it for a week.\n",
      "A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way.\n",
      "One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water;;\n",
      "Another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment;;\n",

      "Except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him.\n",
      "It may, on occasion, be anything but that.\n",
      "However, by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he has a taste for wine.\n",
      "And certainly, in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown.\n",
      "Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown'' -- are the requisites.\n",
      "Most of them, the world over, operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof on the customer himself.\n",
      "This is the only valid, and extenuating, argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter.\n",
      "Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence.\n",
      "The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money.\n",
      "Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served.\n",
      "This is especially true of red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well worth the effort.\n",
      "It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal.\n",
      "otherwise, the cork dries and air enters to spoil it.\n",
      "When stacking wine on its side in a bin, care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork.\n",
      "Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.\n",
      "The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine( provided the eye has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right;;\n",
      "If one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.\n",
      "many people go to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork.\n",
      "No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism!!\n",
      "But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered, and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal.\n",
      "Though by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time.\n",
      "In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal( or the course), in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages.\n",
      "The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire.\n",
      "It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams, Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively.\n",
      "White wines should be opened when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness.\n",
      "The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air.\n",
      "This does not mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good.\n",
      "it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk.\n",
      "By tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well.\n",
      "very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.\n",
      "Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without disturbing the sediment.\n",
      "Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle.\n",
      "In France, when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them.\n",
      "The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines, be decanted.\n",
      "Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer;;\n",
      "Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: `` Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views''.\n",
      "The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer.\n",
      "An excellent crop was expected that year.\n",
      "William, who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish, had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year.\n",
      "The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs, he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes.\n",
      "Gorham refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved??\n",
      "The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves.\n",
      "William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would sue `` amicably'' to protect his interests.\n",
      "Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation.\n",
      "If William wished to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex& age.\n",
      "A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme.\n",
      "When he heard of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages.\n",
      "If not, he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim.\n",
      "William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.\n",
      "Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia.\n",
      "Lacking specific instructions, he agreed to William's condition.\n",
      "`` I considered that your views would be best carried out'', he explained, `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free& more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation.\n",
      "The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to an unnamed newborn child.\n",
      "Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;;\n",
      "In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000.\n",
      "Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66.\n",
      "Thus twenty `` black souls'' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men.\n",
      "According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed.\n",
      "Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement.\n",
      "Otherwise, freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth, or for many years, it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain''.\n",
      "On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition.\n",
      "News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance.\n",
      "Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier, shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair, and that it would reach the `` Ears of the People on the Plantation, and make them restless& unhappy''.\n",
      "His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue.\n",
      "When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him.\n",
      "In view of these difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana.\n",
      "Giffen had already urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.\n",
      "His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April.\n",
      "Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again.\n",
      "During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists.\n",
      "Mrs. Child, who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before, but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana.\n",
      "She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately.\n",
      "Instead of the expected `` annoyances'' due to the nature of his mission, he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark, on whom I had no sort of claim,& have had many more invitations than I could accept''.\n",
      "He proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs, at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high''.\n",
      "Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom.\n",
      "The women by remaining behind condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage.\n",
      "Only one objected, but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others.\n",
      "All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in `` their own little produce''.\n",
      "the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account.\n",
      "William's threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious'' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation as before.\n",
      "Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment& my conscience''.\n",
      "Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage at once.\n",
      "When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally established, Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship.\n",
      "Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.\n",
      "Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844.\n",
      "The plantation was sold in January, 1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages.\n",
      "the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement.\n",
      "On March 21, 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation.\n",
      "Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants.\n",
      "Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves( all more than fifty years old) with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury.\n",
      "After an initial rejection, which he attributed to a `` general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation'', Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury, and got the permission without further delay.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation.\n",
      "An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free.\n",
      "Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction, he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants.\n",
      "Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts.\n",
      "Mrs. Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York.\n",
      "This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.\n",
      "But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest.\n",

      "He had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm.\n",
      "Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out.\n",

      "His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door, was odd.\n",
      "And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing, a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.\n",
      "On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying.\n",
      "He said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house.\n",
      "`` The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge.\n",
      "indeed, it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive.\n",
      "Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her.\n",
      "She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.\n",
      "She replied, `` I know of one man that has not been friendly with him.\n",
      "the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview, but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer.\n",
      "`` Oh, she was just the maid there'', he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was.\n",
      "Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders.\n",
      "Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan.\n",
      "All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers.\n",
      "True, it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations.\n",
      "The actions of Bridget should be examined, since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her innocence.\n",
      "There are also other factors that require closer examination.\n",
      "The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle'' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut.\n",
      "The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to the detriment of Lizzie.\n",
      "She was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time.\n",
      "Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port.\n",
      "There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind.\n",
      "She named 48 items, and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write''.\n",
      "An essay on `` Freedom'' written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada, and the views of George Washington.\n",
      "Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and Elmira, were open to women;;\n",
      "and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied.\n",
      "He recalled Lucy, as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond''.\n",
      "The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.\n",
      "'' And that she proceeded to do.\n",
      "Many years later( on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College: `` While I love botany which, after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing.\n",
      "Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite study.\n",
      "She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone.\n",
      "Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately''.\n",
      "Who won is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words.\n",
      "The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia.\n",
      "`` Their house'', writes Albert S. Flint, `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful to one like myself far from home''.\n",
      "Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor.\n",
      "Winslow, as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize her as `` our iron sister''.\n",
      "There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength, her mental power, her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings'' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country''.\n",
      "They were not sufficiently challenging however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study.\n",
      "After the months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life.\n",
      "What was called an `` accidental meeting'' with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.\n",
      "After correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although there was then no money available to pay her a salary.\n",
      "of `` her exquisiteness of dress'', `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers'';;\n",
      "She drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world;;\n",
      "and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on her purse as well.\n",
      "Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only because of her unobtrusive help.\n",
      "After all, she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except for one year, Associate Principal or Dean.\n",
      "and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal.\n",
      "In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and `` with rare executive ability'' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end''.\n",
      "So strenuous it was physically, with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton.\n",
      "When Dr. Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley( April 7, 1923) `` If you had asked me, I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton.\n",
      "Her services to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her''.\n",
      "She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence;;\n",
      "that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired;;\n",
      "and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly.\n",
      "The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration'' held afterward on the campus, were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles.\n",
      "Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses.\n",
      "Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was `` the sorest grief'' the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear.\n",
      "`` Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots, and will live for the blessing of generations to come''.\n",
      "and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts.\n",
      "Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period.\n",
      "But she decided to stay at Spelman.\n",
      "She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping.\n",
      "Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister''.\n",
      "The books of the school hold a memorial to her;;\n",
      "With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer.\n",
      "These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die work, and sheet-metal work.\n",
      "Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation.\n",
      "In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation.\n",
      "In general, however, it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next.\n",
      "When there is employment opportunity for youth, this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well.\n",
      "Indeed, in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work.\n",
      "Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation, although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one.\n",
      "I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered.\n",
      "He may or may not be `` better off'' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school.\n",
      "But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent.\n",
      "In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation.\n",
      "High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work.\n",
      "And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.\n",
      "This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities.\n",
      "The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers.\n",
      "I believe the situation is improving, but the success stories need to be heavily publicized.\n",
      "Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press.\n",
      "This is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, should devote far more attention.\n",
      "It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South.\n",
      "I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education.\n",
      "however, for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier.\n",
      "Third, the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work;;\n",
      "they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time.\n",
      "Fourth, the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality.\n",
      "This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training, the whole idea of relevance disappears.\n",
      "Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore'' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter.\n",
      "Those who, because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees, would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience.\n",
      "I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls.\n",
      "Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill.\n",
      "To be sure, in tool-and-die work and in the building trades, the first job must be often on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.\n",
      "Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school.\n",
      "Of course, it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.\n",
      "In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation( which may be a profession) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained.\n",
      "In spite of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.\n",
      "Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school.\n",
      "Indeed, one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city, because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs.\n",
      "He prefers to designate such schools as `` general'' high schools.\n",
      "The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community.\n",
      "By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system.\n",
      "It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment, except for a lucky few.\n",
      "One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say, `` I want to be a plumber'', and then, by doing good work, find a job.\n",
      "It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation.\n",
      "In the city, he said, the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in.\n",
      "In a far distant part of the United States, I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work.\n",
      "`` What does he have in mind to do when he graduates''??\n",
      "`` But isn't it almost impossible to get into the union''??\n",
      "Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest.\n",
      "Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment, this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students.\n",
      "I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes.\n",

      "More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States.\n",
      "The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil.\n",
      "The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops.\n",
      "The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages.\n",
      "This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.\n",
      "Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances.\n",

      "Although science has given us more effective materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments.\n",
      "Still another group of seeds( sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible.\n",
      "Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages.\n",
      "The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley, and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry, meat, and dairy products.\n",
      "Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products.\n",
      "Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted.\n",
      "Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out, seekin' grass and water.\n",
      "These became `` strays'', the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like circumstances, were spoken of as `` stray hosses'', not merely `` strays''.\n",
      "you had to go with'em or wait till the storm was over, and follow.\n",
      "The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals.\n",
      "The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays'';;\n",
      "but when a large number were `` bunched up'' or `` banded up'', and marched away from their home range, as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift''.\n",
      "Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds, but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede.\n",
      "Drifts usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had'nough sense to avoid'em, and to find shelter for'emselves.\n",
      "Cattle were said to be `` potted'' when `` blizzard choked'', that is, caught in a corner or a draw, or against a `` drift fence'' durin' a storm.\n",
      "Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill''.\n",
      "When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up''.\n",

      "Hereford cattle were often called `` white faces'', or `` open-face cattle'', and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock'' to them newly introduced cattle.\n",
      "A `` wet herd'' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows, while `` wet stuff'' referred to cows givin' milk.\n",
      "The terminology of the range, in speakin' of `` dry stock'' and `` wet stock'', was confusin' to the tenderfoot.\n",
      "The most common reference to `` wet stock'' was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners.\n",
      "The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals.\n",
      "In the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass, this was spoken of as `` turn-out time'', or `` put to grass''.\n",
      "When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin'''.\n",
      "To stir cattle up and get'em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle'', and the act was called `` ginnin''em'round'', or `` chousin''em''.\n",

      "Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, and givin' the latter a pull to one side.\n",
      "Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough `` tailin''' usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day.\n",
      "Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off balance, and `` bustin''''im with terrific force.\n",
      "Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold'im down was called `` peggin'''.\n",
      "A `` lineback'' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back, while a `` lobo stripe'' was the white, yeller, or brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic of many Spanish cattle.\n",
      "Such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed''.\n",
      "`` Sabinas'' was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'.\n",
      "Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count''.\n",
      "The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead.\n",
      "This method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence, of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd.\n",
      "A `` book count'' was the sellin' of cattle by the books, commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of the seller.\n",
      "This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the `` books won't freeze''.\n",
      "This became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests.\n",
      "The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin.\n",
      "`` Range delivery'' meant that the buyer, after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own, then rode out and tried to find it.\n",

      "No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest.\n",
      "Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler, and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses'', it meant for'im to go out and herd'em in.\n",
      "Later, the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks''.\n",
      "He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed, and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot trail.\n",
      "Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the shadow of the Reef and pointed.\n",
      "The pack had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly.\n",
      "Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party.\n",
      "Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down, cheering them on.\n",
      "Ulyate said, and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked out.\n",
      "Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound.\n",
      "The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called, Ulyate answered from ten feet away.\n",
      "Nice country to meet a lion in face to face.\n",
      "Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of a bush, this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently( and actually had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the dogs whirled around her.\n",
      "Ulyate drew back with a start, and put finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off, `` The dogs have got her bayed.\n",
      "She's just the other side of that bush''!!\n",
      "Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef.\n",
      "She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide, lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation, as much as to say: `` How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct''??\n",

      "( In the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.\n",
      ") She snarled terribly but intuition told him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs.\n",
      "But John nipped her rear end -- one lion's rear end was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.\n",
      "Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her.\n",
      "She whirled and faced him, roaring terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she seemed just a trace uncertain;;\n",
      "while Jones, on the other hand, appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.\n",
      "But now she sank lower to the rock.\n",
      "Her roar changed to a growl.\n",
      "Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched, and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.\n",
      "`` We've got to get her out of there''!!\n",
      "For two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw.\n",
      "But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore away.\n",
      "And the sun was beginning to go down.\n",
      "At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef.\n",
      "But without waiting for them to try it, she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.\n",
      "John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running almost as strongly now as in the morning.\n"

      "But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life.\n",
      "The Christian education of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty.\n",
      "The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives.\n",
      "Most pastors and laymen, even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes.\n",
      "They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical Rover Boys'', as someone has dubbed them, who like to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts that permit them to do so.\n",
      "The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.\n",
      "It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet.\n",
      "It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical.\n",
      "It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots''.\n",
      "One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top'' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels''.\n",
      "The truth, however, is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world.\n",
      "The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations.\n",
      "However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world.\n",
      "It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much.\n",
      "Most people do not realize that the congregation, as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another, is unique.\n",
      "The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.\n",
      "The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love.\n",
      "Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship.\n",
      "The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ.\n",
      "As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it, `` Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us''.\n",
      "This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness, we might prefer not to have any association at all.\n",
      "Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid.\n",
      "Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other.\n",
      "With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches.\n",
      "He often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical'' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church.\n",
      "It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both.\n",
      "As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other.\n",
      "On the one hand, there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town.\n",
      "Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy!!\n",
      "Likewise, the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.\n",
      "On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission.\n",
      "It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members.\n",

      "All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.\n",
      "It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ.\n",
      "It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life.\n",
      "It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples.\n",
      "It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa.\n",
      "It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world.\n",
      "We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world.\n",
      "There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community.\n",
      "Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it.\n",
      "A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, `` Do you belong to this church, Mr. Rancher''??\n",
      "`` Why, no, ma'am'', he replied, `` this church belongs to me''!!\n",
      "There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do.\n",
      "A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church.\n",
      "It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.\n",
      "Yet the truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place.\n",
      "Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms;;\n",
      "and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap.\n",
      "This was a bitterly fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd.\n",
      "At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead'' or the base runners were free to score.\n",
      "This was typical of such games, which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship.\n",
      "Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home, in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox.\n",
      "Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to make the major leagues.\n",
      "Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League, or the Pony League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League, if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.\n",
      "Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams, sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores, that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over.\n",
      "His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life.\n",
      "As the twenties grew older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great hitters( always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account.\n",
      "Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up'' on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.\n",
      "Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his friends, or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least) and who called most of the world `` Kid''.\n",
      "Ruth was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it.\n",
      "A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities, with the encouragement of the press, so that they might see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's, Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'.\n",
      "It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.\n",
      "He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;;\n",
      "and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason.\n",
      ") The sorry fact about this young man, who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public.\n",
      "There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;;\n",
      "or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without a partner;;\n",
      "or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath.\n",
      "One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below, and died at once.\n",
      "The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments, and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too.\n",
      "While fifty years before, Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate.\n",
      "And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars, twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.\n",
      "Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire.\n",
      "Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie `` Joe'' Bush, Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang, third baseman Joe Dugan( who completed the `` playboy trio'' of Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott.\n",
      "By 1926, when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and gray-thatched Earl Combs.\n",
      "The deeds of this team, through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said.\n",
      "But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall.\n",
      "Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach it.\n",
      "The ordinary man and woman, however, saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of any other sporting event for that matter.\n",
      "Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators, and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance.\n",
      "Radio broadcasts, however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers'' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition, became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.\n",
      "In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.\n",
      "This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.\n",
      "While women had always attended ball games in small numbers( it was the part of a `` dead game sport'' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for the home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one.\n",
      "for every grown man( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just as every male American in this era liked to imagine( or pretend) that he could fight with his fists.\n",
      "And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball.\n",
      "Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` Ladies' Days'' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.\n",
      "Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.\n",
      "The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative, despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school.\n",
      "This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal'', and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal.\n",
      "Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers.\n",
      "We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence.\n",
      "Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises.\n",
      "The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy, childhood, and early adolescence.\n",
      "Within Erikson's schema, the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case, her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion'', or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively.\n",
      "Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives.\n",
      "Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early, the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily, by all adolescents( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.\n",
      "Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately.\n",
      "Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love and sex, that would have life-long consequences.\n",
      "Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.\n",
      "However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his( or her) adolescence.\n",
      "In the specific case of time diffusion, we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most( if not all) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.\n",
      "A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy.\n",
      "Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends.\n",
      "To be different is to invite shame and doubt;;\n",
      "and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand, than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status.\n",
      "Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others;;\n",
      "but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self.\n",
      "The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and self-discipline during childhood.\n",
      "The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments, and having created something( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be'').\n",
      "These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities.\n",
      "She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g., whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker;;\n",
      "whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school;;\n",
      "whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school;;\n",
      "and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study.\n",
      "Erikson has noted that, as this indecision mounts, it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship''.\n",
      "and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes.\n",
      "The absence, during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting.\n",
      "These things both express and, at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty.\n",
      "As their identity diffusion increased, they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.\n",
      "These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.\n",
      "On the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior.\n",
      "The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals.\n",
      "In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data.\n",
      "Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as `` either-or'', black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant.\n",
      "Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.\n",
      "It provides identification -- with an idea, a value, a cause that cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion.\n",
      "The positive development, during adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy, initiative, and self-certainty.\n",
      "The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty.\n",
      "A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e., inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways.\n",
      "It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment.\n",
      "In another sense, it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers'' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.\n",
      "The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern,, and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior.\n",
      "They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.\n",
      "and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive'' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant''.\n",
      "In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.\n",
      "For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys'' and the `` bad guys'', to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue, and to explain( or even justify) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social experiences.\n",
      "Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation, which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure.\n",
      "In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.\n",
      "`` It is a duty'', said Hough, `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity, current in this circuit( and probably others), excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.\n",
      "As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer, I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity''.\n",
      "Observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples'', Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures.\n",
      "and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, `` uncalled for and unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct''.\n",
      "William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years.\n",
      "Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House.\n",
      "But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried.\n",
      "In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912, he remarked that `` loose statements'' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts.\n",
      "Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony.\n",
      "In a private communication written in 1911, Parker had been more to the point.\n",
      "Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded'', but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent.\n",
      "The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance'' for or against the patent, said Parker.\n",
      "`` This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur''.\n",
      "Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony.\n",
      "The taking of depositions, he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony.\n",
      "`` I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course( been) pursued, it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that''.\n",
      "Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits.\n",
      "One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes, `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume''.\n",
      "There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade.\n",
      "This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912.\n",
      "In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation.\n",
      "Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.\n",
      "Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry.\n",
      "But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model T and earlier cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor.\n",
      "For those affiliated with it, the A.L.A.M. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900.\n",
      "It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail.\n",
      "`` Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view'', commented a trade journal, `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation''.\n",
      "One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said: `` I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits''.\n",
      "By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information.\n",
      "At this point Charles C. Hanch, long an advocate of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor to the Automobile Board of Trade.\n",
      "Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry, Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.\n",
      "Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents.\n",
      "`` It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned'', said a trade authority, `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system, which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day''.\n",
      "It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough, Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community.\n",
      "He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value.\n",
      "`` My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making'', he later told a Congressional committee.\n",
      "A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina, called the `` Pearl of the Aventine''.\n",
      "Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta.\n",
      "Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section.\n",
      "Turn left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino.\n",
      "Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city.\n",
      "to the piazza Navona and pantheon\n",
      "You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed, a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens.\n",
      "The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C..\n",
      "Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days.\n",
      "Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.\n",
      "Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli, then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei.\n",
      "It's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square.\n",
      "The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement.\n",
      "Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli, where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling.\n",
      "Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini.\n",
      "Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada, built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State.\n",
      "Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, and Rubens are on display( open 9:30 to 4:00).\n",
      "The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death( if so, the statue once stood in the senate house).\n",
      "When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few feet away.\n",
      "The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front.\n",
      "From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese, begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all.\n",
      "Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays( 11:00 to 12:00 noon).\n",
      "Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat.\n",
      "Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori, the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome.\n",
      "Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle.\n",
      "As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey, near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated.\n",
      "Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca.\n",
      "At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2,, walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards, then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona, one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.\n",
      "Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains, its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk.\n",
      "From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages.\n",
      "The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini.\n",
      "Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.\n",
      "Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone, next to the church and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace.\n",
      "Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale;;\n",
      "In front of you is the Palazzo Madama, once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate.\n",
      "Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda.\n",
      "Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling.\n",
      "As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to the right, the Via Del Seminario, a block to Sant' Ignazio, one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city.\n",
      "One block along the Via De Burro( in front of the church) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune.\n",
      "If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria( open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00 to 1:00).\n",
      "Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives.\n",
      "Otherwise, cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left.\n",
      "You will come to Alemagna, a delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries.\n",
      "Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome.\n",
      "The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch, so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best.\n",
      "Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality.\n",
      "( And this is not, perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they are nearly all downtown.\n",
      "It is hard, on the other hand, to blame the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.\n",
      "He has never, himself, done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has??\n",
      "There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt and hatred of a people.\n",
      "And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination.\n",
      "He is not prepared for it -- naturally, nobody is -- and, what is possibly much more to the point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the black people around him.\n",
      "He cannot avoid observing that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children.\n",
      "He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way.\n",
      "One day, to everyone's astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up.\n",
      "Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials, speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding to know what happened.\n",
      "What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men.\n",
      "Negroes want to be treated like men: a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words.\n",
      "The idea seems to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions.\n",
      "I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South.\n",
      "I tried to explain what has happened, unfailingly, whenever a significant body of Negroes move North.\n",
      "They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side;;\n",
      "they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem.\n",
      "The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion is always violent.\n",
      "White people hold the line as long as they can, and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical violence.\n",
      "This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.\n",
      "They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it;;\n",
      "and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse.\n",
      "Well, in the first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse''.\n",
      "I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners, because `` At least there, you haven't got to play any guessing games''!!\n",
      "The guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the river.\n",
      "I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with conviction and with truth, `` The spirit of the South is the spirit of America''.\n",
      "In the second place, though, even if Birmingham is worse, no doubt Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world.\n",
      "but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes.\n",
      "Everything, thereafter, is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need.\n",
      "Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps, the dangers of carnality.\n",
      "Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man.\n",
      "It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward( in which case we are told how many Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few, comparatively, were lynched), or as a victim( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids).\n",
      "It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own: in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself.\n",
      "East River, downtown: postscript to a letter from Harlem\n",
      "the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans.\n",
      "Stevenson stated, in the course of his address, that the United States was `` against'' colonialism.\n",
      "I had intended to be there myself.\n",
      "I was curious to know if Lumumba's death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events, would elicit from `` our'' side anything more than the usual, well-meaning rhetoric.\n",
      "The climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of the `` cold'' war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were `` Communist'' inspired.\n",
      "Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.\n",
      "According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.\n",
      "One has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions.\n",
      "The first question is: Would I like to live here??\n",
      "The answer to both questions is immediately obvious.\n",
      "Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.\n",
      "Now, I do not doubt that, among the people at the U.N. that day, there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives.\n",
      "Wherever there is great social discontent, these people are, sooner or later, to be found.\n",
      "What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.\n",
      "It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated.\n",
      "As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason to adventure further.\n",
      "Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square.\n",
      "The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats.\n",
      "In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, one-minute shows.\n",
      "In response, the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day.\n",
      "The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin S. Porter.\n",
      "Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained since, even in the most inept hands.\n",
      "Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician, discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film.\n",
      "One of these is the `` dissolve'', which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.\n",
      "As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins to appear.\n",
      "In a series of fairy tales and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications, resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions.\n",
      "Immediately, the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.\n",
      "Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers'' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing.\n",
      "The `` projection'' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions.\n",
      "The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, to much variation, as record collectors well know.\n",
      "The `` moving'' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same subject, but the difference is really one of degree;;\n",
      "the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo.\n",
      "Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time.\n"

      "One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery, 1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915.\n",
      "much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's.\n",
      "All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before.\n",
      "Each scene is shot straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play.\n",
      "If the change, at first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen.\n",
      "In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device.\n",
      "He did more than that.\n",
      "The meaning of the word is quite physical, to begin with.\n",
      "The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically, by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.\n",
      "If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in film;;\n",
      "As the robbers leave the looted train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor.\n",
      "We leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events, in `` reality'' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but at a considerable distance.\n",
      "it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both.\n",
      "The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;;\n",
      "There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art.\n",
      "When he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes.\n",
      "Not that there had not been attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that.\n",
      "But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself.\n",
      "Great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera.\n",
      "In all of this extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author.\n",

      "they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration.\n",
      "If it were primarily a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism( with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do.\n",
      "The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit'' of Protestant religious life;;\n",
      "We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers;;\n",
      "consequently, the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations;;\n",
      "The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, to the principle of economic integration.\n",
      "theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world.\n",
      "The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.\n",

      "it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.\n",

      "If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church''( 11.2 per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact.\n",
      "On the surface, this seems a sound approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people;;\n",
      "This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;;\n",
      "the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.\n",
      "The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.\n",
      "The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy( 17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts by members( over two thirds if organizational activities are included).\n",
      "In general, friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church;;\n",
      "the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership.\n",
      "In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation.\n",
      "The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance.\n",
      "It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings.\n",
      "These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.\n",
      "Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.\n",
      "It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.\n",
      "The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations.\n",
      "This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment.\n",
      "More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples.\n",
      "Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis.\n",
      "The identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.\n",
      "Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion.\n",
      "This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches.\n",
      "It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes.\n",
      "It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities.\n",
      "Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people.\n",
      "Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches;;\n",
      "These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major denominations.\n",
      "An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.\n",
      "The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need.\n",
      "With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course to pursue.\n",
      "The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.\n",
      "The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships.\n",
      "In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians.\n",
      "Traders from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty turned to them.\n",
      "Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company.\n",
      "In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony.\n",
      "They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts.\n",
      "In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses.\n",
      "For southeastern Louisiana, Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British traders.\n",
      "Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River.\n",
      "Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain.\n",
      "On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas.\n",
      "It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, principally down the Arkansas River.\n",
      "On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers''.\n",
      "Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada.\n",
      "On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri, `` where there are mines in abundance''.\n",
      "Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible to a director-general at New Orleans.\n",
      "An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way.\n",
      "Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors.\n",
      "Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires, and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.\n",
      "The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires.\n",
      "New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi, and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash.\n",
      "The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined.\n",
      "Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane, and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body.\n",
      "The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and, on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade''.\n",
      "It decided, also, that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.\n",
      "The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts.\n",
      "These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods.\n",
      "The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian needs.\n",
      "De La Laude, commander of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors.\n",
      "Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama, the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees.\n",
      "Venturesome traders, however, continued to come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets.\n",
      "To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile.\n",
      "They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region, from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf.\n",
      "Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices.\n",
      "The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins.\n",
      "But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country.\n",
      "The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724.\n",
      "For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance.\n",
      "Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.\n",
      "But the Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices.\n",
      "Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians.\n",
      "These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians.\n",
      "They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina.\n",
      "They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.\n",
      "So hostile did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke out.\n",
      "Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided to send troops into the troubled country.\n",
      "He asked the government for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians.\n",
      "In spite of the company's restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory.\n",
      "He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts.\n",
      "No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation, gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette.\n",
      "D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many hunters.\n",
      "But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon French trade in the region was at an end.\n",
      "Perier finally, in one last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France.\n",
      "The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the Mississippi.\n",
      "The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts.\n",
      "In January, 1731, the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.\n",
      "It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade.\n",
      "It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity.\n",
      "Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen.\n",
      "The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs, and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families.\n",
      "If this trade should be resumed, the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois.\n",
      "Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts.\n",
      "Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits.\n",
      "He reported, too, that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods.\n",
      "He did find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers to trade.\n",
      "With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all the traders.\n",
      "In order to compete with English traders, Bienville radically changed the price schedule.\n",
      "They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense.\n",
      "After all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer, or the businessman, but to foreigners.\n",
      "Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes??\n",
      "The chances are excellent that he will.\n",
      "The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife.\n",
      "People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers.\n",
      "State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary;;\n",
      "its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way;;\n",
      "embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition.\n",
      "But come the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats.\n",
      "The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.\n",
      "Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney.\n",
      "In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion, groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps.\n",
      "`` The trouble,'' explained Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration, `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do''.\n",
      "One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income.\n",
      "Next day, reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not rise a dollar.\n",
      "Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.\n",
      "With its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it did with Dean Acheson.\n",
      "John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition.\n",
      "So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow.\n",
      "In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy.\n",
      "In any event, the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it.\n",
      "He elected to `` get along''.\n",
      "During this dark chapter in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill.\n",
      "Their successors, absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.\n",
      "In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians.\n",
      "It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself.\n",
      "An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation.\n",
      "They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called `` that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street'', the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians.\n",
      "Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.\n",
      "Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty, the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.\n",
      "Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington.\n",
      "When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change this idea.\n",
      "A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov: `` What should we call you''??\n",
      "And that Menshikov replied: `` Just call me Mike''.\n",
      "Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried: `` Up your bottom''!!\n",
      "For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation of Washington.\n",
      "At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits.\n",
      "Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to smile.\n",
      "Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and `` Smilin' Mike'' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.\n",

      "The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mrs. Golda Meir.\n",
      "Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions.\n",
      "Of course, most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets -- inside.\n",
      "The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well.\n",
      "They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning.\n",

      "In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers.\n",
      "The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination.\n",
      "The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me, and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary school, and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school.\n",
      "There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools.\n",
      "With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength.\n",
      "The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents.\n",
      "There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability.\n",
      "The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused.\n",
      "I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they??\n",
      "It will be painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop.\n",
      "They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good, except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like.\n",
      "My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel, but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome.\n",
      "My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen, but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students, however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.\n",
      "I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.\n",
      "At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated.\n",
      "After a supper of unagi( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji), I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.\n",
      "We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending.\n",
      "They apologized for the condition, including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what to say.\n",
      "There seemed to be no excuse??\n",
      "We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family.\n",
      "and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest, but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become the priest.\n",
      "In his big home live four families and thirty people, so it needs to be big.\n",
      "Also, there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc..\n",
      "He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them.\n",
      "About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum.\n",
      "Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara.\n",
      "Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.\n",
      "In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima.\n",
      "Again the plan was for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me.\n",
      "At Osaka, Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night.\n",
      "One spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river.\n",
      "In the midst of a great busy city, people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.\n",
      "I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little, after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around.\n",
      "I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to.\n",
      "They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan.\n",
      "There were no words to say this but there was no need.\n",
      "The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming.\n",
      "On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University.\n",
      "It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning.\n",
      "Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs.\n",
      "I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants.\n",
      "Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.\n",
      "At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated.\n",
      "Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community.\n",
      "As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions.\n",
      "Here the women learn to keep house as maids;;\n",
      "They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family.\n",
      "Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, and work effectively in keeping a shiny house.\n",
      "After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen of which Masu had planned, Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo.\n",
      "Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.\n",
      "But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case.\n",
      "It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice, must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy.\n",
      "Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation.\n",
      "Moreover, prudence alone would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country( as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover a large number of southern adherents).\n",
      "In any case, anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed, a `` high yellow gal'' smooching with a white man.\n",
      "It is true, of course, that the end or objective of this action was different.\n",
      "But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present, there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force.\n",
      "The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence.\n",
      "The end or aim of the action, of course, is also important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e.g., against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the present moment.\n",
      "Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies.\n",
      "This, however, is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict( if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used.\n",
      "It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just, i.e., that, if economic pressure has to be resorted to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while, if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily( however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them.\n",
      "It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality, like any other form of resistance.\n",
      "The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory( perhaps to be chosen above all others).\n",
      "One of the sit-in leaders has said: `` Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom.\n",
      "Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them''.\n",
      "The present writer certainly agrees with that statement, and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice.\n",
      "However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward.\n",
      "R. B. Gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance.\n",
      "and again, that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope.\n",
      "In another respect it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values''.\n",
      "A trial of strength, however, is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent;;\n",
      "This makes necessary a morality of means, and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified.\n",
      "The question, then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him.\n",
      "Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives;;\n",
      "and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.\n",
      "A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression.\n"

      "Among Christian groups, the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure.\n",
      "Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love, it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing.\n",
      "`` The primary objective of non-violence'', writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, `` is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage''.\n",
      "Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance.\n",
      "Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted, but clearly specified;;\n",
      "and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.\n",
      "That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.\n",
      "The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good.\n",
      "In these terms, the `` economic withdrawal'' of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out.\n",
      "We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.\n",
      "There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people.\n",
      "An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa, amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions.\n",
      "`` Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers'', this author states, `` are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white''.\n",
      "This leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue''.\n",
      "Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country, but also in accord with our law, U.S. Code Title 19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor.\n",
      "Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author believes, `` must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation''.\n",
      "The race problem has tended to obscure other, less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.\n",
      "It is these other differences between North and South -- other, that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein.\n",
      "A Southerner married to a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, and business executives of egghead tastes.\n",
      "This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that the best government was the least government.\n",
      "Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints.\n",
      "When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy, I find that they fall into two categories: the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis;;\n",
      "and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day.\n",
      "I am naive, they say, to make use of such words.\n",
      "I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical??\n",
      "-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it.\n",
      "This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court.\n",
      "but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.\n",
      "If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, why not make this known to the world??\n",
      "And if he is so scornful of the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support??\n",
      "It appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends.\n",
      "His assumption seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views.\n",
      "Time's editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, The Waist-High Culture, wrote: `` most of what was different about it( the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to.\n",
      "Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism.\n",
      "I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North.\n",
      "But in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more.\n",
      "In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down.\n",
      "Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view.\n",
      "But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings.\n",
      "From my wife's experience and other sources, this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles.\n",
      "My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War.\n",
      "I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe.\n",
      "Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy.\n",
      "Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful;;\n",
      "and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South.\n",
      "so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, important minority enclaves.\n",
      "The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and the consciousness of loss the greater.\n",
      "Also, we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence.\n",
      "The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area.\n",
      "Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country.\n",
      "Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors.\n",
      "All Southerners agree that slavery had to go;;\n",
      "but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did.\n",
      "But apart from racial problems, the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North.\n",
      "It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise.\n",
      "There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it.\n",
      "Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream, like everybody else.\n",
      "If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true.\n",
      "Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War- 1 great power have been, following conquest, ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike.\n",
      "This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination.\n",
      "The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot and cold.\n",
      "So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion.\n",
      "Had the situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain.\n",
      "It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have.\n",
      "The North should thank its stars that such has been the case;;\n",
      "The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries.\n",
      "Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure.\n",
      "The Bourbon economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern conservatives.\n",
      "They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America.\n",
      "As it is, they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way'' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter.\n",
      "The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure.\n",
      "Their own easier, slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners;;\n",
      "and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.\n",
      "It became the sole `` subject'' of `` international law''( a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham), a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena.\n",
      "Speaking generally, it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers.\n",
      "The enormous changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era.\n",
      "Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility, either internally or externally.\n",
      "That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.\n",
      "His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated.\n",
      "Thus, to cite but one example, the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century, whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other nations( e.g., the United States) may have incidentally benefited.\n",
      "At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted.\n",
      "Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.\n",
      "In what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution'', the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature( the `` night-watchman state'') to one with affirmative duties to perform.\n",
      "For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine'', President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious `` Court-packing plan'', the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation.\n",
      "A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for, as will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept.\n",
      "Thirty years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces'' to operate and cure the distress.\n",
      "That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal;;\n",
      "less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.\n",
      "Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution.\n",
      "Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era.\n",
      "National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations.\n",
      "Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties.\n",
      "It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, former colonial nations.\n",
      "The Rule of Law, historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court'' before an impartial tribunal, was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare.\n",
      "Recognizing that the Rule of Law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society'', the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized''.\n",
      "Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish.\n",
      "The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.\n",
      "The content is not the same, however: rather than individual security, it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group'' -- those in the `` free world'' -- that is basic.\n",
      "External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations.\n",
      "If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.\n",
      "Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle.\n",
      "In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally, against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church.\n",
      "The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism.\n",
      "( Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order, something permanent and unchanging.\n",
      ") The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.\n",
      "But it is more than that.\n",
      "For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit.\n",
      "Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm.\n",
      "Historically, however, the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group.\n",
      "By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual liberty.\n",
      "While the pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well.\n",
      "It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number( approximately 100).\n",
      "In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application, both as to geography and as to population;;\n",
      "To him, law is the command of the sovereign( the English monarch) who personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e., to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.\n",
      "These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual( internal-external) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power.\n",
      "High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.\n",
      "That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies, in which `` popular'' sovereignty is said to exist, and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split.\n",
      "Nevertheless, nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted wisdom, to describe the modern world.\n",
      "The short answer to those questions is `` yes''.\n",
      "to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility.\n",
      "As evidence to support that view, consider the following illustrative instances.\n",
      "What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents??\n",
      "Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety??\n",
      "I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest''.\n",
      "I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons'' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.\n",
      "To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched.\n",
      "In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` E hour''.\n",
      "There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.\n",
      "They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines.\n",
      "Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.\n",
      "Among the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware'', the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios''.\n",
      "The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will -- but possibly might.\n",
      "Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men: The more highly placed they are -- that is, the more they know -- the more concerned they have become.\n",
      "Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption'', `` escalation'', `` unauthorized behavior'' and other terms that will be discussed in this report.\n",
      "It is their job to think about the unthinkable.\n",
      "Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese, too -- thought about accidental war.\n",
      "In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.\n",
      "BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD( North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for interpretation;;\n",
      "to the SAC command and control post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska;;\n",
      "to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.\n",
      "The same principle of `` redundancy'' applies to all communications on these special networks.\n",
      "And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special codes, that the messages actually come from their purported sources.\n",
      "Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.\n",
      "Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.\n",
      "But what if somebody decides to break it??\n",
      "Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons.\n",

      "Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation??\n",
      "However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.\n",
      "Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.\n",
      "Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj.\n",
      "If communications work, his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order.\n",
      "No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate.\n",
      "In emergencies the SAC commander, Gen. Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff.\n",
      "He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the big red button marked alert.\n",
      "In point of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right.\n",
      "In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special codes, each message also contains an `` internal authenticator'', another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing.\n",
      "I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one.\n",
      "`` I'd wind up full of bullet holes'', he said, and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.\n",
      "Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's, on alert near their `` positive control( or fail-safe) points'', the spots on the map, many miles from Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets.\n",
      "At any rate, three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message.\n",
      "Each must match Wisman's `` pie'' with the fragment that he carries with him.\n",
      "All three must compare notes and agree to `` go''.\n",
      "After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released.\n",
      "It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth.\n",
      "Watching, they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land.\n",
      "Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot.\n",
      "Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley.\n",
      "Their gait is impossible to convey in words.\n",
      "It is the gait of the human who must run to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful.\n",
      "Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.\n",
      "He bent down, a black cranelike figure, and put his mouth to the ground.\n",
      "With a lordly and generous gesture, the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.\n",
      "Which does not mean that it is ugly.\n",
      "They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.\n",
      "They lay, with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.\n",
      "he knows that the land is hard and pitiless.\n",
      "He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback'' is awful.\n",
      "Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.\n",
      "I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but I suspect that it can.\n",
      "Others are confined to vast reservations, and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed.\n",
      "I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived `` outback'' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush.\n",
      "It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language.\n",
      "The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big red boulder, swung off the road.\n",
      "At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel.\n",
      "It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about.\n",
      "Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks, a tree here, a wash here, a boulder there.\n",
      "Two miles northeast, then five miles southwest that sort of thing.\n",
      "I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless.\n",
      "They'll move around that rock all day, following the shade.\n",
      "During the hottest part of the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade''.\n",
      "We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover, and walked over toward the family.\n",
      "There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what.\n",
      "It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets.\n",
      "A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink.\n",
      "I turned to look at the lubra.\n",
      "Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.\n",
      "The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work.\n",
      "The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.\n",
      "It was also subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.\n",
      "One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.\n",
      "But that is a cliche and a dishonest one.\n",
      "The smell is sexual, but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.\n",
      "They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it.\n",
      "`` They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other.\n",
      "At the corroborees, when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell.\n",
      "Idje, here'', and he nodded at the man, `` is said to have great odor.\n",
      "The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded''.\n",
      "The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.\n",
      "It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art.\n",
      "The architects, the tile and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city.\n",
      "At the heart of all of this was the square, which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious, as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe''.\n",
      "In time Isfahan came to be known as `` half the world'', Isfahan nisf-i-jahan.\n",
      "In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the size of London, started to decline.\n",
      "Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East.\n",
      "Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.\n",
      "But even for them it remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb, a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead.\n",
      "Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present.\n",
      "It seems that for Persia, and especially for this city, there are only two times: the glorious past and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present.\n",
      "However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared.\n",
      "The promenade, for example, continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street.\n",
      "It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, and also in the gardens of the square.\n",
      "And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar.\n",
      "Those three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse, and the zur khaneh( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics, dance, chanted poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture: long, domed, chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches.\n",
      "But more important, and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.\n",
      "Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form -- these things are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness.\n",
      "I should like, by the way, to make it clear that I am not using the word `` Persians'' carelessly.\n",
      "These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary.\n",
      "A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor.\n",
      "Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge.\n",
      "for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in.\n",
      "It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans, and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas 2, in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present bridge.\n",
      "Here, in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between.\n",
      "Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and river pools.\n",
      "On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge.\n",
      "Crowds press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades, massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege.\n",
      "All kinds come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal;;\n"

      "Many of them, moreover, are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant.\n",
      "Nonetheless, they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks.\n",

      "Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided.\n",
      "Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another love, and so on, to include all of the emotions.\n",
      "The singer simply matches the poem to a mode;;\n",
      "for example, the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem: `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains;;\n",
      "Go, tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was one''.\n",

      "As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent.\n",
      "Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically is piped into the public rooms, and which nolens volens had to be endured.\n",
      "As he talked about himself, time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe, Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled.\n",
      "In his native Cologne, where his mother taught him to play the piano, he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet.\n",
      "Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra, and during World War 1,, when musicians were scarce, he joined the opera orchestra as well.\n",
      "Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.\n",
      "`` By observing the conductor'', he says with a twinkle in his eyes, `` I learned how not to conduct''.\n",
      "Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony, as well in the violin and piano.\n",
      "he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera, and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor.\n",
      "Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post??\n",
      "Had he always wished to be a conductor??\n",
      "No, originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such.\n",
      "Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera, after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky, teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold.\n",
      "During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany.\n",
      "At the outset of his career, Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year.\n",
      "In Frankfurt, too, he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which, in addition to the standard repertoire, featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony.\n",
      "Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's, Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community.\n",
      "Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues, with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann.\n",
      "In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor.\n",
      "Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony.\n",
      "He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.\n",
      "First of all, to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi, a place he loves.\n",
      "Since it is not far from Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's house, as he never fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme, which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces.\n",

      "The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest.\n",
      "My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner''.\n",
      "He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour, especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies, and Das Lied Von der Erde, and Bruckner's Sixth -- which is rarely played -- and Seventh.\n",
      "Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony''.\n",
      "He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans'', the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.\n",
      "`` Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us, I am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler''.\n",

      "I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today''.\n",
      "With all his musical activities, did he have the time and inclination to do anything else??\n",
      "He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals.\n",
      "He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain, but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago.\n",
      "Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments.\n",

      "`` Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men' of England''??\n",
      "Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts, I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry.\n",
      "I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly.\n",
      "`` It is easy for you to talk'';;\n",
      "We would like to do that too''.\n",
      "When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount, the young people looked at me doubtingly.\n",
      "`` Would you advise us to act the same way??\n",
      "I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck''.\n",
      "Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding.\n",
      "The ideal home, they agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and two children.\n",
      "No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory.\n",
      "All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.\n",
      "It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril'' and of `` national opportunity'' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation.\n",
      "Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.\n",
      "In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today, for there was nobody before them to show them the way.\n",
      "As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789, `` We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us.\n",
      "They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words, as `` the Argonauts'' who had lived in `` the Heroic Age''.\n",
      "Accordingly, they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity.\n",
      "Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather, as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen, that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved''.\n",
      "Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences.\n",
      "Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off, enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.\n",
      "Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary.\n",
      "Eldest of the seven, Benjamin Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the most dazzling success story in our history.\n",
      "Author of the Albany Plan Of Union, which, had it been adopted, might have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania, and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention.\n",
      "Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President.\n",
      "His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders.\n",
      "Principal author of `` The Federalist'', he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly.\n",
      "He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period.\n",
      "Washington castigated his critic, General Conway, as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity''.\n",
      "And Hamilton, who felt it `` a religious duty'' to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint.\n",
      "The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service.\n",
      "Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests.\n",
      "Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best, plantation management.\n",
      "John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, to `` pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it''.\n",
      "In taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded that `` no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did'' and `` for so little profit''.\n",
      "Hamilton, poorest of the seven, gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet.\n",
      "While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.\n",
      "To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service.\n",
      "Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party.\n",
      "`` I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his family'', he reflected.\n",
      "All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality.\n",
      "John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world'' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature's God''.\n",
      "They fought hard, but they were forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783.\n",
      "Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack.\n",
      "Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement:\n",
      "`` As an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack''.\n",
      "The latter in turn assured him that `` were I arraigned at the bar, and you my judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause''.\n",
      "All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation.\n",
      "`` We have now a national character to establish'', Washington wrote in 1783.\n",
      "This new force, love of country, super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one's own state, was epitomized by Washington.\n",
      "All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers.\n",
      "In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution, and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff.\n",
      "Indeed, the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats.\n",
      "When, in 1832, the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman.\n",
      "In his political testament, `` Advice To My Country'', penned just before his death, Madison expressed the wish `` that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.\n",
      "Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened;;\n",
      "Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop.\n",
      "Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which, despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture, has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers.\n",
      "Indeed, it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road, with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps, continue to live -- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.\n",
      "Those writers known collectively as the `` Southern school'' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize;;\n",
      "according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "It is interesting, however, that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops;;\n",
      "of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century.\n",
      "This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian;;\n",
      "It is said that, even at the present stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton.\n",
      "As for progress, the `` backward South'' can boast of Baton Rouge, which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000.\n",
      "The field, then, is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban economy, the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems;;\n",
      "William Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes.\n",
      "Where are the writers to treat these changes??\n",
      "Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted??\n",
      "Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades.\n",
      "Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.\n",
      "An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865.\n",
      "Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South, which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat of paint.\n",
      "But there have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines, the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.\n",
      "Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states( South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi) still openly defy integration, would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.\n",
      "Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the buses;;\n",
      "his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions, better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954.\n",
      "Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion.\n",
      "He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters, refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws.\n",
      "It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs'' and `` sho' nufs'' with blissful deference to his white employer( or, in Old South terms, `` massuh''), this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester.\n",
      "While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed.\n",
      "Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man;;\n",
      "All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life.\n",
      "Many earlier writers, mourning the demise of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious Old South'' imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's `` Tara'' Plantation.\n",
      "Modern writers, who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century.\n",
      "but they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead.\n",
      "As John T. Westbrook says in his article, `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism''( Southwest Review, Winter 1957): `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever dead and( let us fervently hope) forever done with''.\n",
      "Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees: `` Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence( of urbanization) presented to his senses.\n",
      "On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight''.\n",
      "Obviously, such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland: he wants to see a world of make-believe.\n",
      "In the meantime, while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee, Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress.\n",
      "Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard.\n",
      "Even two decades ago in Go Down, Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil.\n",
      "Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which seep into the South, building layer upon layer of minute, subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way.\n",
      "Thus Faulkner reminds us, and wisely, that the `` new'' South has gradually evolved out of the Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist.\n",
      "Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself: the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.\n",
      "The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.\n",
      "Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre.\n"

      "Most avant-garde creators, true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement, have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors( often black) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting.\n",
      "He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace, so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity.\n",
      "For Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with grass.\n",
      "Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor.\n",
      "To raise the dancer out of his personal, pedestrian self, Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger, environmental orbit.\n",
      "He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be.\n",
      "He went on to use objects -- hoops, poles, capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer, who moved with them.\n",
      "In each case, the object, the color, even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer.\n",
      "The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol, begins to feel that it is part of herself.\n",
      "Or, clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops, the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial''.\n",
      "As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments are animized, and the combined elements give birth to a new being.\n",
      "From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit.\n",
      "But, since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity, how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal??\n",
      "Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work.\n",
      "Others, less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times, experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet, painter, and musician.\n",
      "An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse: `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception''.\n",
      "The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience.\n",
      "The unit of form is determined subjectively: `` the Heart, by the way of the Breath, to the Line''.\n",
      "The test of form is fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters.\n",
      "An earlier but still influential school of painting, surrealism, had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience, that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious.\n",
      "The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions, but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order.\n",
      "The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines, colors, masses, and energies.\n",
      "The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.\n",
      "Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities, than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher, more serene level of truth.\n",
      "But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight, rather than his immediate impressions, that gives form to the work.\n",
      "Others look to more objective devices of order.\n",
      "The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that, once set in motion, determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.\n",
      "But a tossing of coins, with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching, the Chinese Book Of Changes, dictates the handling of the chosen materials.\n",
      "Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements, have turned to similar approaches.\n",
      "According to Katherine Litz, `` the becoming, the process of realization, is the dance''.\n",
      "The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it.\n",
      "or it may involve more subtle distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged, its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head.\n",
      "An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance.\n",
      "The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz, or spontaneous, as it is for Merle Marsicano.\n",
      "The design is determined emotionally: `` I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me''.\n",
      "Looking back, Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock.\n",
      "At one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage'', much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas.\n",
      "But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape itself.\n",
      "Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement.\n",
      "It may be a free front-back swing of the leg, leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground.\n",
      "A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.\n",
      "Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion.\n",
      "He seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike'' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape, light, color, and sound.\n",
      "If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world, a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities.\n",
      "It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered.\n",
      "It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following movements constituting further reactions.\n",
      "It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color, in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs.\n",
      "He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity, any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect.\n",
      "He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything.\n",
      "An order can be chanced rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered''.\n",
      "Thus, there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well.\n",
      "Chance, he finds, enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination''.\n",
      "The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life.\n",
      "A man and a girl happen to meet;;\n",
      "He lifts her, puts her down, and walks off, neither pleased nor disturbed, as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon.\n",
      "The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed.\n",
      "The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.\n",
      "The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate total duration of the dance.\n",
      "Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method;;\n",
      "he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.\n",
      "However, there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute.\n",
      "He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other.\n",
      "He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap.\n",
      "The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their Union.\n",
      "Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear thought and timely action.\n",
      "Even so, confusion in this period gained such strength( from compromise and other factors) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century.\n",
      "Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.\n",
      "The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War.\n",
      "And so I would only touch upon it now( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it).\n",
      "I think it is essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject.\n",
      "The difference came down to this: The Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last analysis, what its name implied -- a Union of States.\n",
      "To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it.\n",
      "This right of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government.\n",
      "The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right to secede, though the citizens could.\n",
      "Writing to Speed on August 24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear.\n",
      "In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede.\n",
      "We began by declaring that all men are created equal.\n",
      "When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy''( His emphasis)\n",
      "When the Southern States exercised their `` right to secede'', they formed what they officially styled `` The Confederate States of America''.\n",
      "The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did.\n",
      "Many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede.\n",
      "But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede.\n",
      "Their President, Jefferson Davis, interpreted their Constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association'', but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution''.\n",
      "The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation'' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects: It openly, defiantly, recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution.\n",
      "They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "'' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six( instead of four) years, and was limited to one term.\n",
      "The only important differences from that standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles.\n",
      "The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they were acting directly as citizens.\n",
      "`` we the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America''.\n",
      "`` We the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America''.\n",
      "One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought.\n",
      "But though the Southern States, when drafting a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states.\n",
      "If the Union conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede: This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union.\n",
      "Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism''.\n",
      "Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state'' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it.\n",
      "After the war began, he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union.\n",
      "He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union.\n",
      "In his Message of December 2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: `` In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free''.\n",
      "What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union.\n",
      "He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people, by the people, for the people''.\n",
      "The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater.\n",
      "On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men, living and dead, who fought here''.\n",
      "He understood that both sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural.\n",
      "To my knowledge, Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth.\n",
      "So great a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend.\n",
      "It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union.\n",
      "They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth: That individual life, liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty, in all its aspects, which this involves.\n",
      "The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion'' to prevent disunion, preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy, inherent in confederations, which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states, and to the liberties of their people.\n",
      "But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways.\n",
      "Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man.\n",
      "The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for, since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure.\n",
      "There was also a lesson, one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in their conflicts with one another, from turning from the ballot to the bullet.\n",
      "The lives so many of them gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe.\n",
      "As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new `` unnatural'' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world.\n",
      "The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments.\n",
      "One wonders about its applicability to people.\n",
      "Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction??\n",
      "Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes.\n",
      "But it has been during the last two centuries, during the scientific revolution, that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides.\n",
      "we fly through the air, although gravity pulls us down;;\n",
      "Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton??\n",
      "And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.\n",
      "Political theoretical understanding, although almost at a standstill during this century, did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man.\n",
      "Most of these, with horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to survive and enjoy it.\n",
      "The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme.\n",
      "Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics, so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding.\n",
      "I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science, the connection between scientific understanding and fear.\n",
      "There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears.\n",
      "Lucretius has remarked: `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause, and these they attribute to the will of God''.\n",
      "It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man.\n",
      "We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was.\n",
      "We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets.\n",
      "We are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button''.\n",
      "I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears, but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly.\n",
      "They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual.\n",
      "They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group.\n",
      "Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but, because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding, one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized.\n",
      "Yet often fear persists because, even with the most rigid ritual, one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act.\n",
      "To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition.\n",
      "The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize.\n",
      "It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice.\n",
      "This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions.\n",
      "This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls.\n",
      "In fact, although we have dispelled the fear, we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers.\n",
      "Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which, in this case, amounts to doing nothing.\n",
      "This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive, for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war.\n",
      "And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave.\n",
      "We have staved off a war and, since our behavior has involved all these elements, we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective.\n",
      "I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city.\n",
      "If an automobile were approaching him, he would know what was required of him, even though he might not be able to act quickly enough.\n",
      "He does not know whether to look up or look aside, to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross the street, or to continue on the same side.\n",
      "When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others.\n",
      "I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics.\n",
      "I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose.\n",
      "Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise.\n",
      "We are forced, in our behavior towards others, to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements.\n",
      "We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles.\n",
      "Small wonder, then, that we fear.\n",
      "The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment.\n",
      "Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears.\n",
      "In agriculture, for example, despite the advances in biology, elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster.\n",
      "The persistent horror of having a malformed child has, I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained any control over this misfortune, but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it.\n",
      "In fact, insofar as science generates any fear, it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise, which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.\n",
      "The situation with regard to our attitude and `` control'' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people.\n",
      "The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe.\n",
      "My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work.\n",
      "American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic.\n",
      "Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot'' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair''.\n",
      "But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism.\n",
      "Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me??\n",
      "Is his a literature of defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face??\n",
      "Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves??\n",
      "I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself.\n",
      "When Beckett's name came into the discussion, the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life''.\n",
      "Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle.\n",
      "For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to impose himself upon another.\n",
      "He seems, by some unconscious division of labor, to have given them that one function and no other, leaving communication to the rest of the face.\n",
      "The voice is light in timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.\n",
      "We walked down the Rue De L'Arcade, thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church.\n",
      "The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering.\n",
      "For one thing, the world that Beckett sees is already shattered.\n",
      "His talk turns to what he calls `` the mess'', or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion''.\n",
      "What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words.\n",
      "We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion.\n",
      "It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in.\n",
      "The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess.\n",
      "I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, but Beckett did not take to the word truth.\n",
      "To swim is true, and to sink is true.\n",
      "One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that now is simply the mess''.\n",
      "Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form.\n",
      "It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form.\n",
      "`` How could the mess be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be''??\n",
      "I granted this might be so, but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.\n",
      "How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to chaos??\n",
      "Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art??\n",
      "Plays more highly formalized than `` Waiting For Godot'', `` Endgame'', and `` Krapp's Last Tape'' would be hard to find.\n",
      "`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art.\n",
      "It only means that there will be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else.\n",
      "The latter is not reduced to the former.\n",
      "To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist now''.\n",
      "Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way??\n",
      "What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory??\n",
      "The Boulevard De La Madeleine, the Boulevard Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery, bearing tidings of the Age of Reason.\n",
      "This does not allow the mystery to invade us.\n",
      "There is the unexplainable, and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer''.\n",
      "Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside.\n",
      "If life and death did not both present themselves to us, there would be no inscrutability.\n",
      "It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable.\n",
      "At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark.\n",
      "Given a theological lead, I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.\n",
      "He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel.\n",
      "One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs''.\n",
      "Some people object to this in my writing.\n",
      "As if it were perverse to do so!!\n",
      "He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood.\n",
      "I told him no, that I had had a very happy childhood.\n",
      "One does not have to look for distress.\n",
      "Lunch was over, and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us.\n",
      "The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays.\n",
      "He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern.\n",
      "As a writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays.\n",
      "Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting For Godot'' is a reflection( he calls it a distorted reflection) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life''.\n",
      "Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to.\n",
      "The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it is the consciousness that most `` mature'' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.\n",
      "Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all.\n",
      "Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature, it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex.\n",
      "Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy.\n",
      "For the beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct.\n",
      "He has elevated sex -- not Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous, uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead;;\n",
      "Jazz is sex, marijuana is a stimulus to sex, the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.\n",
      "Lawrence Lipton, in The Holy Barbarians, stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure;;\n",
      "it is a mystique, and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse.\n",
      "The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place.\n",
      "It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity, for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.\n",
      "They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety.\n",
      "This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond.\n",
      "In addition, they have been converted to Zen Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is `` natural'' and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in the world is flowing.\n",
      "Thus, paradoxically, the beat writers resort to `` religious'' metaphors: they are in search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous, but not anything connected with formal religion.\n",
      "And Zen Buddhism, though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled, helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release.\n",
      "The style of life chosen by the beat generation, the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own, is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience.\n",
      "indeed, it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz, by freeing the listener of his inhibitions, can have therapeutic value.\n",
      "Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction.\n",
      "Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy, the sacred road to integration of being.\n",
      "The mystique of sex, combined with marijuana and jazz, is intended to provide a design for living.\n",
      "Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats;;\n",
      "let them learn to `` swing'' freely, to let go, to become authentically themselves, and then perhaps civilization will be saved.\n",
      "The beatnik, seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present.\n",
      "He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.\n",
      "they will destroy the shrines, temples, museums, and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in.\n",
      "Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge.\n",
      "And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive, even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing, painting, music.\n",
      "When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth, the rage of repudiation, the ecstasy of negation.\n",
      "It is sex that obsesses them, sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.\n",
      "What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse.\n",
      "Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability.\n"

      "We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before our eyes.\n",
      "The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable, in the air.\n",

      "But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides.\n",

      "Cows were kept in backyard barns, boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.\n",
      "The wife, Amra, and her lover are both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, `` voluptuous'' and `` indolent'', possibly `` a mischief maker'', with `` a kind of luxurious cunning'' to set against her apparent simplicity, her `` birdlike brain''.\n",
      "Lautner, for his part, `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves'', and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs'', the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order'', and the somewhat extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled: `` They will be destroyed''.\n",
      "The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well.\n",
      "At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life.\n",
      "But it is characteristic of him, we are told, `` his little artifice'', to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art''.\n",
      "`` A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude''.\n",
      "It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, his wife's infidelity.\n",
      "By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience;;\n",
      "the epiphany of that quivering flesh;;\n",
      "the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius( which, however, does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering'');;\n",
      "When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay.\n",
      "The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love.\n",
      "This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art;;\n",
      "The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough'' in the realm of art.\n",
      "Again, the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood, with the figure of a child.\n",
      "We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.\n",
      "For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together in prophetic parody.\n",
      "Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up, disguised -- that is, paradoxically, revealed -- as a child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child.\n",
      "That this abandonment takes place on a stage, during an' artistic' performance, is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the punishment for art;;\n",
      "that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion, and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique, magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner.\n",
      "It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface, is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic.\n",
      "Something of this can be learned from `` The Way To The Churchyard''( 1901), an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure.\n",
      "There is no more `` plot'' than that;;\n",
      "The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.\n",
      "The first sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent: `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran beside it all the way to the end;;\n",
      "that is to say, to the churchyard''.\n",
      "The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while the way to the churchyard belongs to death.\n",
      "But that is too simple, and won't hold up.\n",
      "As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong to death in the end.\n",
      "But the highroad, according to the description of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death, while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life: a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death.\n",
      "also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account.\n",
      "His name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` Death In Venice'', for example, who represent some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.\n",
      "The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace young fellow, is not named but identified simply as `` Life'' -- that and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him.\n",
      "`` Life'' points out that `` everybody uses this path'', and starts to ride on.\n",
      "Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest from `` Life'', and is left standing in impotent and growing rage, while a crowd begins to gather.\n",
      "that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now, but the audience, the world, as well: `` all you light-headed breed''.\n",
      "The season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree aspect.\n",
      "as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments: `` His justice is not of this world''.\n",
      "Life is further characterized, in antithesis to Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears at several places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon is `` admirable'', `` a pleasure to contemplate'';;\n",
      "His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings;;\n",
      "`` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth''.\n",
      "He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard''.\n",
      "But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist.\n",
      "And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing: the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverkuhn.\n",
      "In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism'', anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional composition, in which, as Leverkuhn says, `` there shall be nothing unthematic''.\n",
      "It resembles, too, pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.\n",
      "in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress.\n",
      "On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse: `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter''.\n",
      "The `` reality'' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world.\n",
      "Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.\n",
      "The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.\n",
      "The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery.\n",
      "All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism: if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at least invent an artistic `` reality'' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved.\n",
      "Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive, that they belong together.\n",
      "And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written.\n",
      "A broader concept of imitation is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important, that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises.\n",
      "On the other hand, we cannot regard artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times in which it occurs.\n",
      "We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism.\n",
      "Accordingly, it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation) and a new theory of invention( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter).\n",
      "In Plato's judgment, the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young, prior to the full development of their intellectual powers.\n",
      "Presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom.\n",
      "Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.\n",
      "The Poetics, in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation'', gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato.\n",
      "But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths.\n",
      "For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality.\n",
      "The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation( based upon a recognition of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved.\n",
      "I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis'' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved, as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.\n",
      "In the first instance, `` mimesis'' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations.\n",
      "Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself.\n",
      "The images themselves, like their counterparts in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately;;\n",
      "they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another.\n",
      "They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality.\n",
      "As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images.\n",
      "Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense.\n",
      "A word taken in its dictionary meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing of a `` scene'' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings.\n",
      "Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field.\n",
      "A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy.\n",
      "The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials.\n",
      "When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance.\n",
      "Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs.\n",
      "In contrast to all this, primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.\n",
      "The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself;;\n",
      "a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part.\n",
      "In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught.\n",
      "It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection.\n",
      "he is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world, not directly perceived.\n",
      "Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail, is initially given in the way man feels the world.\n",
      "Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am.\n",
      "After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications of melioration, though `` in a slight degree'', to be sure.\n",

      "For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them.\n",
      "It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually, constantly.\n",
      "The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue, to `` show the world that'' as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries) `` however bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it''.\n",
      "In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North.\n",
      "At the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of `` integration'' in the North than in the South.\n",
      "But people can't be made to integrate, socialize( the two are inseparable by Southern standards) by law.\n",
      "I was having lunch not long ago( apologies to N. V. Peale) with three distinguished historians( one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed, majestic instancy''( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit) by judicial fiat.\n",
      "They didn't seem to be able to think of any.\n",
      "A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change.\n",
      "But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said, `` They make a desert, and call it peace''( `` Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant''.\n",
      "The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed''.\n",
      "To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority'', which, he said, `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial or local legislation''.\n",
      "Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community??\n",
      "Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed''??\n",
      "A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell.\n",
      "He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere.\n",
      "The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.\n",
      "You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys, and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity.\n",
      "New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces, South as well as West.\n",
      "They may even enroll a colored student or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or any place other than the American South.\n",
      "It would be interesting to know how much `` integration'' there is in the famous, fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England.\n",
      "that is, about one-half of one per cent, which looks pretty `` tokenish'' to me, especially in an institution which professes to be `` national''.\n",
      "I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith.\n",

      "A man must be able to say, `` Father, I have sinned'', or there is no hope for him.\n",
      "Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural'' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came''.\n",
      "Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade.\n",
      "Emerson -- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn'', delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause: `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim.\n",
      "The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on the contrary still wished to continue it.\n",
      "for though their people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others''.\n",
      "But that was a long time ago.\n",
      "It was nice to be able to isolate it.\n",
      "New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster to the Nation.\n",
      "It is true that New England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education from the start.\n",
      "But I think that something more than this is involved.\n",
      "How did it happen, for example, that the state university, that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country??\n",
      "Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England( Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously been A& M colleges??\n",
      "Was it supposed, perchance, that A& M( vocational training, that is) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West??\n",
      "Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university??\n",
      "they had less immigration to contend with.\n",
      "He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools.\n",
      "And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land!!\n",
      "I don't propose to go into their history, but I have one or two surmises.\n",
      "One is that they were established, or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants, from whom the old families wished to segregate their children.\n",
      "Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English.\n",
      "Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago.\n",
      "He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part.\n",
      "Being somewhat delicate in health, at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine.\n",
      "In one of his summers at home he married, to the great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.\n",
      "Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction.\n",
      "`` I scanned the world through printed symbol swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man.\n",
      "In this final line, we have the key to his nature.\n",
      "It may, however, be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.\n",
      "It was a brilliant debut, so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's Childe Harold.\n",
      "In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it.\n",
      "It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence.\n",
      "On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection.\n",
      "Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal.\n",
      "A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations: `` Not men-folk, but the fields where I would stray, The stones where as a child I used to play''.\n",
      "What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause'' to which he can honestly devote himself.\n",
      "This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden.\n",
      "His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.\n",
      "The hero, who is himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East, a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Book again, `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life.\n",
      "He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden''.\n",
      "From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self.\n",
      "He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory.\n",
      "Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up.\n",
      "Heidenstam's conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories of the past.\n",
      "In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace.\n",
      "Hence the title of the book, referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king;;\n",
      "on the fatal battlefield of Poltava, to quote from the novel, `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people''.\n",
      "Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat.\n",
      "George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style.\n",
      "The career of Charles 12, is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon.\n",
      "His purpose, however, was not to establish an empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice.\n",
      "Each aspired to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god.\n",
      "Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him.\n",
      "After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.\n",
      "This comes out in `` When The Bells Ring'', which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.\n",
      "From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden.\n",
      "This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, `` A Hero's Funeral'', written in the form of an impassioned prose poem.\n",
      "The guns are fired, the hymns are sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors.\n",
      "As he had longed to be, he became the echo of a saga.\n",
      "Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries.\n",
      "Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background.\n",
      "Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12, it is unnecessary to speak.\n",
      "Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not.\n",
      "It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited.\n",
      "As a free-lance investigator, the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client.\n",
      "For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure, whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine.\n",
      "no client would ever think of asking him to do such things.\n",
      "He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so( frequently he does not receive a fee at all), but because he enjoys his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished.\n",
      "By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost.\n",
      "At the same time, because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man.\n",
      "There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement: Adam Smith was wrong.\n",
      "Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly capitalism.\n",
      "Now, although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction.\n",
      "Even on the fictional level, however, the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved.\n",
      "The individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct: he enforces the law without being told to do so.\n",
      "but his morality rests upon that of his society.\n",
      "The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.\n"

      "Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network.\n",
      "As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement, or exclamation.\n",
      "For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, `` What time is it''??\n",
      "This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car.\n",
      "Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command.\n",
      "However, for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1.\n",
      "Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors.\n",
      "The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another.\n",
      "All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum, while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged.\n",

      "Looking at the diagram, we see that Af connection lines come in to each member.\n",
      "Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness.\n",
      "The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.\n",
      "For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then the `` open house'' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door.\n",
      "We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2.\n",
      "It will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors, h and e have six, and p has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers.\n",
      "In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point like f in Figure 2 would( other things being equal) be the dwelling place for the community leader, while e and h would house the next most important citizens.\n",
      "The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort.\n",

      "In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even in the field, are more formal.\n",
      "This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action.\n",
      "The connective system, or network, is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college, or a rural village.\n",
      "The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are:( A) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching, indoctrinating, etc..\n",
      "( B) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times.\n",
      "And( D) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank.\n",
      "These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top, six directly under him, six under each of these, and so on until there are six levels of personnel.\n",
      "This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent.\n",
      "A further regulation is that commands always go down, unaccompanied by statements, and statements always go up, unaccompanied by commands.\n",
      "It will readily be seen that in this suggested network( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice.\n",
      "Furthermore, the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced.\n",
      "Not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare, where the surveillance, sending, transmitting, and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks.\n",
      "Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach.\n",
      "This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated, although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss, for example, in precision machinery and mathematics, or the Finns in geochemistry.\n",
      "We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes.\n",
      "First, we realize that a pure specialist does not exist.\n",
      "For example, there are persons who are in physical science, in the field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction, to clay minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites;;\n",
      "So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops, as contrasted to the generalist, who knows less and less about more and more.\n",
      "Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850.\n",
      "I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental law.\n",
      "But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it.\n",
      "He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1,, evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America.\n",
      "He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic Christianity'' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism''.\n",
      "Let me quote him even more fully, for his analysis is important to my theme.\n",
      "He says: `` beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress, as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism, should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy''.\n",
      "I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism.\n",
      "It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man.\n",
      "That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more.\n",
      "It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy.\n",
      "During the decade that followed, the common man, as that piece put it, grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow( Wilson) only to learn from Science, to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him, and that too much couldn't be expected of him.\n",
      "The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution, or of the Jacksonian frontier.\n",
      "What had happened to the common man??\n",
      "The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity, however, prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of one sort of another.\n",
      "The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson.\n",
      "Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s, the dislocations of the Depression, the common ethos of Materialism everywhere, all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little People.\n",
      "However, it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former.\n",
      "The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us, however.\n",
      "This notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship.\n",
      "And it is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle, in his remarkable long essay, The Heresy Of Democracy, and in a more general way by Voegelin, in his New Science Of Politics, that this same Rousseauan idea, descending through European democracy, is the source of Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n",
      "This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2, and our great democratic victory that brought no peace.\n",
      "The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy, into a worship of man, led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State.\n",
      "We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework, finally and at last, to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world: the United Nations.\n",
      "During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal.\n",
      "During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon: the atom bomb.\n",
      "All of this, I know, is recent history familiar to you.\n",
      "But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man, to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership.\n",
      "He opens his discourse, however, with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents, all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age.\n",
      "And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation: `` in essence the drama of his( Eisenhower's) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism''.\n",
      "I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle, with its limited and precarious success, toward conservatism.\n",
      "For it was neglected, not to say nascent, when the struggle began.\n",
      "But I'm not here to define conservatism.\n",
      "What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course.\n",
      "One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election, I suppose, is that we, the majority, were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism.\n",
      "Though, to be sure, we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment.\n",
      "But before I try to diagnose it, I would offer other evidence.\n",
      "I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year.\n",
      "The contributors to this testament were all well-known: a former Democratic candidate for President, a New Deal poet, the magazine's chief editorial writer, two newspaper columnists, head of a national broadcasting company, a popular Protestant evangelist, etc..\n",
      "What I want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals, or modified liberals, with perhaps one exception.\n",
      "And I would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song.\n",
      "Its refrain was: `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation''.\n",
      "Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes''.\n",
      "But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent.\n",
      "They, perhaps, gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University, because it was non-partisan.\n",
      "The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal, but not unconscious enough, to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism.\n",
      "And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above: `` the paramount goal of the United States set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual, ensure his development, enlarge his opportunity''.\n",
      "This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological.\n",
      "But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common man's malaise.\n",
      "Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence, too, though I may add, with considerably more historical perception.\n",
      "I will reserve discussion of it for a moment, however, to return to President Kennedy.\n",
      "Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy, not to say confused, state of the public mind??\n",
      "Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower??\n",
      "And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic.\n",
      "But there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.\n",
      "Here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth, determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth.\n",
      "One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before.\n",
      "So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation.\n",
      "We are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth, not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today.\n",
      "Otherwise, we go on endlessly trying to draw the line, color and other, as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate.\n",
      "We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted, if nothing else.\n",
      "We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything??\n",
      "So in these pages the term `` technology'' is used to include any and all means which could amplify, project, or augment man's control over himself and over other men.\n",
      "If we were creating a wholly new society, we could insist that our social, political, economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man;;\n",
      "So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs.\n",
      "In a book review of `` The Soviet Cultural Offensive'', he says, `` Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders, the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes, as when the enterprising promoters of' Porgy And Bess' overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary' cultural warfare' behind the enemy lines.\n",
      "Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world, an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies.\n",
      "Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur'' no more exists in America.\n",
      "If we want respect from ourselves or others, we will have to earn it.\n",
      "First, let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times, now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership.\n",
      "When we `` forced'' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes, we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism'' and so took a major step toward socialism.\n",
      "The biggest loss, of course, was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy.\n",
      "But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic.\n",
      "Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations, a credit to any society.\n",
      "But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life, will not stand close scrutiny.\n",
      "Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham.\n",
      "It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that.\n",
      "As to benefits to employees, it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.\n",
      "The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism, vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy.\n",
      "But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo), unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism, the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole.\n",
      "So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can, without regard to the needs of society, controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival.\n",
      "Ideally speaking, it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services, and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society.\n",
      "Examples are in public utilities, making military aircraft and accessories, or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form, e.g. constructing major airports or dams.\n",
      "Thus, if corporations are not to run away with us, they must become quasi-governmental institutions, subject to public control and needs.\n",
      "In all other areas, private initiative of the `` proprietorship'' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services.\n",
      "Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli, e.g., quarterly and annual dividend reports.\n",
      "Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal, inhumane, shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated, a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public.\n",
      "The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders.\n",
      "Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop.\n",
      "Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied, complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.\n",
      "Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest.\n",
      "Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations, e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth.\n",
      "Corporations should pay added taxes, to be used for educational purposes( not necessarily of the formal type).\n",
      "The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated.\n",
      "To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore, and is basically anti-democratic.\n",
      "When the proprietor dies, the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it.\n",
      "Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent, as they are each a part of the whole.\n",
      "Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so.\n",
      "If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system, how can we expect to abolish it internationally??\n",
      "These proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual, who, in turn, would help us to cope with runaway technology.\n",
      "Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition.\n",
      "We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed, enlightened, competent leaders.\n",
      "Persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside.\n",
      "In my own company, in effect a partnership, although legally a corporation, I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal'' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do.\n",
      "Also, I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership, I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees.\n",
      "The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties, neither having a formal education applicable to, or experience in, manufacturing or selling our type of articles.\n",
      "From an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943, it has grown, with no additional capital investment, to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000( we don't disclose financial figures to the public).\n",
      "Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time, despite substantial, well established competition.\n",
      "Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force.\n",
      "Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails.\n",
      "Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails, in direct violation of their constitutional rights.\n",
      "Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government.\n",
      "Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions.\n",
      "They give strict interpretation to William James' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself''.\n",
      "They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new.\n",
      "Hence, the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion, unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.\n",
      "Despite this danger, however, we are informed on every hand that ideas, not machines, are our finest tools;;\n",
      "So all-important are ideas, we are told, that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent new ideas of their own, and those who borrow, beg, or steal from others.\n",
      "Seemingly, with an unrestricted flow of ideas, all will be well, and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away''.\n",
      "Criminals, as well as model citizens, exercise their minds.\n",
      "The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n",
      "An inmate, a former university professor, expounded to us, logically and clearly, that someone was pilfering his thoughts.\n",
      "He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done.\n",
      "The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655, when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years.\n",
      "He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone.\n",
      "No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater.\n",
      "It would have been unwise policy, for instance, to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman.\n",
      "Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual.\n",
      "Reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews.\n",
      "Does this help the non-Jew to understand this group??\n",
      "Thomas De Torquemada, Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition, put many persons to death.\n",
      "A successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together.\n",
      "Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years??\n",
      "Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive.\n",
      "But is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then, after stirring, expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result??\n",
      "Is there some magic in it that assures results??\n",
      "When Peter B. Kyne( Pride Of Palomar, 43) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese, did the heated debates of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition??\n",
      "If a child had a single drop of Negro blood, he would revert to the ancestral line which, except as slaves under a superior race, had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years.\n",

      "`` I may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age'', the President had said on February 29th of the election year, ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term.\n",
      "`` My doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great''.\n",
      "Ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than President Eisenhower the possibility to which his own words, in the press conference held at the beginning of August, testified: that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country, unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation.\n",
      "So it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present.\n",
      "Moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him, he adopts a position that is morally indefensible.\n",
      "He ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him.\n",
      "As a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place, the statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions.\n",
      "But it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history.\n",
      "In assigning to God the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors, Eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow.\n",
      "In any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock.\n",
      "About this man we had to think twice.\n",
      "We knew that it was, as reassurance, the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature.\n",
      "But the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions, and thus for imposing his will on the people.\n",
      "When the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners, Mr. Eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more.\n",
      "it was not to be resumed.\n",
      "The portrait that had developed, fragmentarily but consistently, was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits, when it does not forestall, any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence.\n",
      "This does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked.\n",
      "Instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision, as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done.\n",
      "Despite three warnings, no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation, and thus his responsibilities, from Wilson's.\n",
      "By contrast, the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man.\n",
      "Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked.\n",
      "In the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail, and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant, with what is sometimes astounding rapidity.\n",
      "Like Lincoln, he can distinguish his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him.\n",
      "He chooses to subordinate one to the other, sometimes reluctantly, accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed.\n",
      "The very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader.\n",
      "But because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it, we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction, in the sphere of politics, on which decisions hang.\n",
      "Only recently, and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail, have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics.\n",
      "and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language interacts with the other two.\n",
      "For this change is not a change from one positive position to another, but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation.\n",
      "Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration.\n",
      "The division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change.\n",
      "Rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society.\n",
      "The civilizational crisis, the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do''??\n",
      "There is no socially existential answer to the question.\n",
      "If we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two, one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke.\n",
      "There the community, faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice, can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced.\n",
      "For paradigmatic history `` breaks'' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder, and not from one order to a new order.\n",
      "The liberal-conservative split, to define it further, derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification.\n",
      "When disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order, the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return.\n",
      "Indeed, it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins.\n",
      "At that point we reach the `` closed'' historical situation: the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante.\n",
      "At that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate'', or `` destiny'', or `` providence'', and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society.\n",
      "The content of that psychological status determines, ultimately, the content of civilization.\n",
      "Those social, civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group, ultimately cease to exist.\n",
      "Its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man, since he is always incomplete, to complete himself.\n",
      "It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse.\n",
      "He needs existential completion, he needs, that is, to move in the direction of completion.\n",
      "And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself.\n",
      "Thus, it is no mystical intuition, but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence''.\n",
      "This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself, of a nature that, in Maritain's words, is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities''.\n",
      "Thus with regard to the loss of tradition, in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul, a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent, but no longer as a man.\n",
      "With regard to the change we are examining, the question is, at what point does the change become irreversible??\n",
      "A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process.\n",
      "This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being.\n",
      "If the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation.\n",
      "And when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence, any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence.\n",
      "It would seem, therefore, that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself.\n",
      "The emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder.\n",
      "And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth.\n",
      "As a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history.\n",
      "To experience them, it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it.\n",
      "Within the individual the reaction has been called various names, all, however, pointing to the same basic experience.\n",
      "Others call it `` alienation'', and mean by that no simple economic experience( as Marx does) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation.\n",
      "Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis, two basic organizations of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism.\n",
      "Both are predictably destined to fail.\n",
      "Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces.\n",
      "To this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers.\n",
      "The implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible.\n",
      "The problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there.\n",
      "Such a response, of course, misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence.\n",
      "Moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order, once the activation of change has reached visible proportions.\n",
      "The most reaction can achieve is stasis, and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself.\n",
      "Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class, reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class.\n",
      "Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change.\n",
      "Since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze, it seldom is given adequate attention.\n",
      "The basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational.\n",
      "The reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations.\n",
      "In both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality.\n",
      "When the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense, the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction.\n",
      "It is a total situation that is defended: the `` good old days''.\n",
      "The point is that the reactionary, for whatever motive, perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself, something which, consequently, he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference.\n",
      "A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love, only makes us a little weary of man;;\n",
      "Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward, but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history.\n",
      "We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man, Dostoevsky, a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman.\n",
      "It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex.\n",
      "Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth, an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime, and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret.\n",
      "I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller.\n",
      "Incest is still a durable theme, but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions, and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation.\n",
      "And the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story.\n",
      "Which brings to mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal theme.\n",
      "If I now risk some comparisons with Sons And Lovers let it be clear that I am not comparing the two works or judging their merits;;\n",
      "`` The Rocking Horse Winner'' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why.\n",
      "There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse.\n",
      "The child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother.\n",
      "The story ends in the child's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother.\n",
      "But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story.\n",
      "It was, of course, a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself, and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal.\n",
      "The rocking is actually felt in the story, a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy.\n",
      "The rocking, I realized, is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message, the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit.\n",
      "And if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy.\n",
      "We are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend, while the incestuous love of the man, Paul Morel, sometimes repels.\n",
      "It's easy to see why.\n",
      "This love belongs to childhood;;\n",
      "And when the child dies in Lawrence's story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich, the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all.\n",
      "We have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion.\n",
      "I am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood.\n",
      "It is most probable that Freud and the Oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story.\n",
      "He was simply writing a story that wanted to be told, and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged.\n",
      "He would not have cared why it emerged, he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy.\n",
      "In our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage.\n",
      "Ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled.\n",
      "He borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist's own.\n",
      "If many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior, that the ego is still the executive agency of personality, and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego.\n",
      "The novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an Oedipus complex all men must have the same faces.\n",
      "I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature.\n",
      "But a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth, the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness.\n",
      "Moral dread is seen as the other face of desire, and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity.\n",
      "There is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories I have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth.\n",
      "The ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies, but the myth fails before the modern truth;;\n",
      "Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell.\n",

      "At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement'', according to Herbert Read, `` and in the direct line of descent from Cezanne, Seurat, Gris and Leger''.\n",
      "In America, Meyer Schapiro observed that, unlike the Mondrian school, Helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art''.\n",
      "It is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of Cimabue's and Poussin's way of filling space.\n",
      "but, he held, instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction'', it must grow, must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian.\n",
      "The extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold.\n",
      "He was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions.\n",
      "But he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration, a functional art of some kind''.\n",
      "During the 1920's the Abstractionists, the German Bauhaus group of industrial designers, and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia, or welfare state, in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place.\n",
      "But whereas the postwar American abstractionists seem to Helion to be determined to `` escape'' from the real world, or simply to rebel against it, the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of `` improving'' things.\n",
      "`` We were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come, very pure and elevated'', he has said, `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918''.\n",
      "Very much the political man, Helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of France and all Europe, whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky.\n",
      "In 1936 he decided to migrate to America.\n",
      "The Rooseveltian America was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization.\n",
      "Helion also hoped that America's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works.\n",
      "In New York he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists, including Alexander Calder, George K. L. Morris, De Kooning, Holty and a few others.\n",
      "After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square, having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia, Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains, where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases.\n",
      "The darkening world scene, at the time of the Munich Pact, continued to trouble his mind even in his remote Virginia studio.\n",
      "In haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings: a three-panel frieze, with a flying figure and a fallen figure;;\n",
      "a `` Double-Figure'', which went to the Chicago Art Institute, and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts;;\n",
      "`` I knew I was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me'', he said of the two years' output in Virginia.\n",
      "With those paintings of big constructions crashing down, he felt he could stop.\n",
      "They were, in effect his last testament to non-objective art.\n",
      "but after war came to Europe, he decided to return to France, arriving there in January, 1940.\n",
      "`` I hated the war'', he said, `` but thought I ought to go because I was, perhaps, one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it''.\n",

      "At Stettin the university-educated artist, who had studied German, was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander.\n",
      "In the Stalag, Helion came to know and love his comrades, most of them plain folk, who, in their extremity, showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other.\n",
      "How much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape.\n",
      "Every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories.\n",
      "One evening, while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there, a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work.\n",
      "The guards all rushed up to intervene''\n",
      "not only loathing of captivity, but a faith, a hope that is even stronger.\n",
      "They too loved their families, longed for their villages: yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape''.\n",
      "Helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando 13,, Stettin, as to his own fierce will and love of life.\n",
      "After that, he declared, `` to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore it''.\n",
      "In prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life, his guards, his companions in misery.\n",
      "Before leaving for America, he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions.\n",
      "Helion, however, clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the Stalag I had also escaped from Abstraction''.\n",
      "and the author, who seemed the embodiment of France's rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors, was much complimented for his daring military action.\n",
      "But when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp, they paid him no compliments and drew long faces.\n",
      "These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most, hence associated with the sense of lost freedom: the cafe at the corner, the newspaper kiosk, the girls in doorways and windows along the street, the golden-crusted French bread they lacked, the cigarettes denied them.\n",
      "others were of men doffing their hats to each other, carrying umbrellas with pomp, reading newspapers, or simply showing loaves of bread spread out.\n",
      "Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay, his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has.\n",
      "He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne, for example, and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism, material progress, and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs.\n",
      "Faulkner's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O'Donnell implies that it is.\n",
      "He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social, cultural, or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford, Mississippi, thirty-five years ago.\n",
      "That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions, of course, that he is steeped in them, in fact, or that he has dealt with them, in his books.\n",
      "It is to say rather, I believe, that he has brought to bear on the history, the traditions, and the lore of his region a critical, skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique.\n",
      "The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern, I rather think, for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity.\n",
      "Some of us might be inclined to argue, in fact, that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation, either mental or physical, are particularly Southern traits.\n",
      "There is no necessity, I suppose, to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern.\n",
      "It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family.\n",
      "The young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner, and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so.\n",
      "Besides showing no inclination, apparently, to absent himself from his native region even for short periods, and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region, he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years.\n",
      "It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge.\n",
      "His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South, implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation.\n",
      "His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding, it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written about the South.\n",
      "But in looking at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South, it is important not to lose the broader perspective.\n",
      "Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers, who deal in extravagant horror, to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century, and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists, Henry James and James Joyce among them.\n",
      "His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach, but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him.\n",
      "My intention, therefore, is not to say that Faulkner's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South, but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern.\n",
      "A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made, I think, by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region.\n",
      "The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come, however, until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed.\n",
      "As they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away, they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed.\n",
      "Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition, he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society.\n",
      "Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism, we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War.\n",
      "It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard, for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow, who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society.\n",
      "They have an ancestry extending back, however, at least to 1728, when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of Virginia and North Carolina.\n",
      "There is evidence to suggest, in fact, that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South.\n",
      "William Gilmore Simms, sturdy realist that he was, pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans, to vivify the pale writings being produced around him.\n",
      "Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods, but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully.\n",
      "Johnson Jones Hooper, whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will;;\n",
      "It would be profitable, I believe, to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works, the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly, but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time, to Faulkner's time.\n",
      "Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent.\n",
      "Such characters, with their low existence and often low morality, produce humorous effects in his novels and tales, as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris, but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers;;\n",
      "nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters.\n",
      "One of the early humorists already mentioned, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials.\n",
      "Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty.\n",
      "Some years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science that `` man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are( now) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age''.\n",
      "As a Humanist, Dr. Huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development, and one thing we can say about this suggestion, which comes from a leading zoologist, is that, so far as he is concerned, the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution.\n",
      "This text from Dr. Huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings.\n",
      "There may be a case of this sort, but it is not one we wish to argue, here.\n",
      "Even if people do, in a not far distant future, begin to read one another's minds, there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more, that is, than what you can read in good books.\n",
      "Even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners, one may question whether this will help them to live better lives.\n",
      "There would be side-conclusions to be drawn, of course;;\n",
      "such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists;;\n",
      "but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling, and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article.\n",
      "All we want from Dr. Huxley's statement is the feeling that this is an open world, in the view of the best scientific opinion, with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next, and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible.\n",
      "It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one, but many.\n",
      "Each man, that is, is both one and many.\n",
      "He is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect, and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time.\n",

      "Here, on a desk, is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions.\n",
      "The pamphlets are about law, the corporation, forms of government, the idea of freedom, the defense of liberty, the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions, the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization.\n",
      "The thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor.\n",
      "There is another kind of ardor, a quiet, sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life, but no angry utopian contentions.\n",
      "Actually, you could wish for some passion, now and then, but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought, you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm.\n",
      "You could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity.\n",
      "Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents, we think, an achieved plateau of reflective thinking.\n",
      "After casting about for a way of describing this spirit, we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford's introduction as an illustration.\n",
      "At one time it seemed as if the Soviet Union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations.\n",
      "As things turned out, however, we have not profited greatly from the lesson: instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at the moment.\n",
      "Such activity may or may not have irritated the Kremlin, but it has frequently condemned America to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world.\n",
      "The defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit, our tendency to rate the `` goodness'' or `` badness'' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves.\n",
      "Since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot, the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government.\n",
      "Shocked at the response to our proclamations, we grow more defensive, and worse, we lose our sense of humor and proportion.\n",
      "Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our Department of State, and an American President observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic''.\n",
      "One thing you can say about Mr. Lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an American.\n",
      "Those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination.\n",
      "The maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood.\n",
      "Even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society.\n",
      "If our sincerity is granted, and it is granted, the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination.\n",
      "What is more, the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason, and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels.\n",
      "Although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise'', `` individual initiative'', `` the democratic way'', `` government of the people'', `` competition of the marketplace'', etc., we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas, bureaucracy is corroding representative government, technology is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make decisions, and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground''.\n",
      "The interesting thing about Mr. Lyford's approach, and the approach of the contributors to The Agreeable Autocracies( Oceana Publications, 1961) to the situation of American civilization, is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on American life.\n",
      "In an ideological argument, the participants tend to thump the table.\n",
      "They are determined to prove something.\n",
      "The new spirit, so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford's work, is wholly free of this anxiety.\n",
      "The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening, and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present, sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system, our mass media, our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves''.\n",
      "We experience a vague uneasiness about events, a suspicion that our political and economic institutions, like the genie in the bottle, have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them.\n",
      "We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set, but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us, we can hardly learn to control them.\n",
      "It does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose.\n",
      "The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today.\n",
      "The men who speculate on these institutions have, for the most part, come to at least one common conclusion: that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature, and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world''.\n",
      "No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century.\n",
      "But however we come, finally, to explain and account for the present, the truth we are trying to expose, right now, is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises.\n",
      "Should Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television, atomic energy, and IBM machines??\n",
      "They tell us, sir, that we are free, because we have in one hand a ballot, and in the other a stock certificate.\n",
      "With these we shape our destiny and own private property, and that, sir, makes ours the best of all possible societies.\n",
      "Many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts.\n",
      "Thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall;;\n",
      "and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all''.\n",
      "The obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens.\n",
      "As early as the 6th century B.C. the earth was seen to be spherical.\n",
      "The discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things.\n",
      "In light of all this, one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular.\n",
      "Why, for example, should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical??\n",
      "By distinguishing superlunary( celestial) and sublunary( terrestrial) existence, and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of Empedocles, Aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies, which moved in only a perfect way, viz. in a perfect circle.\n",
      "To return now to the four-element physics, a mixture of muddy, frothy water will, when standing in a jar, separate out with earth at the bottom, water on top, and the air on top of that.\n",
      "This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements.\n",
      "Thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe.\n",
      "It is covered( partly) with water, air is atop of that.\n",
      "When combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum, it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios, celestial bodies will be of a subtle, quickened, ethereal existence, in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.\n",
      "This is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions.\n",
      "A projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its' natural' place of rest.\n",
      "Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy.\n",
      "No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld into a single scheme( a-la-Aristotle), these independent predicting-machines.\n",
      "But that one should superimpose all these charts, run a pin through the common point, and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller( to keep the epicycles from' bumping'), this is contrary to any intention Ptolemy ever expresses.\n",
      "He might even suppose the planets to move at infinity.\n",
      "Ptolemy's problem is to forecast where, against the inverted bowl of night, some particular light will be found at future times.\n",
      "The distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master, beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth.\n",
      "But none of this has prevented scientists, philosophers, and even historians of science, from speaking of the Ptolemaic system, in contrast to the Copernican.\n",
      "Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion.\n",
      "So when textbooks, like that of Baker set out drawings of the' Ptolemaic System', complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents, we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically.\n",
      "It is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent.\n",
      "In Ptolemaic terms, however, eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter, to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations.\n",
      "In a systematic astronomy, like that of Copernicus, retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system;;\n",
      "It is often stated that Copernican astronomy is' simpler' than Ptolemaic.\n",
      "Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former.\n",
      "Thus, Margenau remarks: `` A large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations, but otherwise the( Ptolemaic) system served well and with quantitative precision.\n",
      "Copernicus, by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe, was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen.\n",
      "Historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called' revolution', unaware perhaps of its historical importance, he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction.\n",
      "As an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized;;\n",
      "it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen''.\n",
      "If in any one calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once, while Copernicus never required more than one third this number, then( in the sense obvious to Margenau) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than Copernican.\n",
      "This is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems.\n",
      "Analogously, anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler than Newton's, must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists, while the former can be managed( with difficulty) only by accomplished experts.\n",
      "But' simplicity' here refers to systematic simplicity.\n",
      "The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum.\n",
      "The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully, so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms, rules, and primitive notions.\n",
      "The lower-level hypotheses are never' ad hoc', never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum.\n",
      "Copernicus, to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy, approximated to Euclid's vision.\n",
      "Granted, the cosmological, philosophical, and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow.\n",
      "The formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' primary concern, was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy, namely, the' unphysical' triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which the planet's distances were calculated, another around which planetary velocities were computed, and still a third center( the earth) from which the observations originated.\n",
      "This arrangement was for Copernicus literally monstrous: `` With( the Ptolemaists) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and other members for his images from divers models, each part excellently drawn, but not related to a single body;;\n",
      "His objective was, essentially, to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends.\n",
      "Without abandoning too much, Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable.\n",
      "He did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution.\n",
      "Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite''.\n",
      "Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta, as every artist delights to do, wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women: `` In their relations, she was the giver and he the receiver, nay the demander.\n",
      "One is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive, and women as submissive and yielding, that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned, and we condemn the woman as a coquette.\n",
      "The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts;;\n",
      "usually, this is most exasperating to men, who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex, and when she does not, immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly.\n",
      "She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist, of showing her superiority in argument over a man.\n",
      "Women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world, and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will, even when their affections are withheld.\n",
      "She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done.\n",
      "One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy, overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger.\n",
      "In any case but the last, such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual;;\n",
      "Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing, as the born writer does, not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation, insight and intuition.\n",
      "Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger, `` so our readers will be benefited instead''.\n",
      "Under her father's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the Jewish field, but she did begin writing for other Anglo-Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience.\n",
      "By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life Of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration.\n",
      "Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins University within walking distance of home.\n",

      "and although it was a school for men only, it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures.\n",
      "In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students, and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study, and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel, who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings.\n",
      "Adler, Judge Sulzberger's nephew, came to study Assyriology.\n",
      "A smart, shrewd and ambitious young man, well connected, and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people, he was bound to go far.\n",
      "and bright though they all were, they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa, whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were.\n",
      "Besides, Miss Henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing;;\n",
      "so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald, and Joe Jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta, and signed himself Joe -- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel.\n",
      "Henrietta, however, was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe's older and more serious brother, Morris, who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa, when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph Shalom Temple there during its Rabbi's absence in Europe.\n",
      "Young Morris, who, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, also taught and edited a paper, found time to write Henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest, from the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith'' on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.\n",
      "Unlike his younger brother, Joe, he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend'', although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style.\n",
      "And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do, Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did.\n",
      "One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself.\n",
      "and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged'' and `` women as submissive and yielding'', felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once, in sheer desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.\n",
      "But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters, or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable, lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street.\n",
      "and, `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world'', burst out Jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family, which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight;;\n",
      "and the Szold family, as it developed, bore a striking resemblance to the Marches.\n",
      "and `` Marmee'' March, like Sophie Szold, was the competent manager of her brood of girls, of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds' five.\n",
      "But both were high-spirited and vivacious, both had tempers to control, both loved languages, especially English and German, both were good teachers and wrote for publication.\n",
      "Bertha Szold was more like Meg, the eldest March girl, who `` learned that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling it, not as a queen, but a wise wife and mother''.\n",
      "Sadie, like Beth March, suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits.\n",
      "When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism, Sadie learned to write with her left hand.\n",
      "and she recited `` Hector's Farewell To Andromache'' most movingly, to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia, where the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore.\n",
      "For Rachel, conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular March counterpart;;\n",
      "but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian.\n",
      "and, as in the March home, any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them.\n",
      "and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality, he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta, in whom he was really interested, but to all the Szold girls and Mamma.\n",
      "And just as `` Laurie'' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March, who found him immature by her high standards, and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy, so Joe Jastrow, who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins, had to content himself with her younger sister, pretty Rachel.\n",
      "And like Jo March, who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering'' before herself, Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors, Rachel by Joe Jastrow, and Sadie by Max Lobl, a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi.\n",
      "Almost from that day, until his death, Olgivanna was to stay at his side;;\n",
      "but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying, both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady.\n",
      "It must be granted that the flouting of convention, no matter how well intentioned one may be, is sure to lead to trouble, or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval.\n",
      "Even so, many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe.\n",
      "Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty: Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for.\n",
      "Reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere, and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright and his doings.\n",
      "Flocks of writs, attachments, and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air.\n",
      "The distracted Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative, then change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person.\n",
      "At last her lawyer, Arthur D. Cloud, gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged.\n",
      "Cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client: `` I wanted to be a lawyer, and Mrs. Wright wanted me to be an avenging angel.\n",
      "The first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case.\n",
      "But every time I suggested this to her, Mrs. Wright turned it down and demanded that I go out and punish Mr. Wright.\n",
      "Miriam Noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor, and appointed a heavy-faced young man named Harold Jackson to take his place.\n",
      "and during the unhappy time, Miriam often would charge that Wright and Olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of Wisconsin.\n",
      "Yet somehow, when officers were prodded into visiting Taliesin to execute the warrants, they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna at home.\n",
      "This showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle.\n",
      "To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna, we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person.\n",
      "At this time Miriam Noel appeared, urging on Constable Henry Pengally, whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin gate, and William Weston, now the estate foreman, came out to parley.\n",
      "He said that Mr. Wright was not in, and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that Miriam was waving in the air.\n",
      "Miriam now ordered Pengally to break down the gate, but he said he really couldn't go that far.\n",
      "At this point Mrs. Frances Cupply, one of Wright's handsome daughters by his first wife, came from the house and tried to calm Miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock.\n",
      "Turning to the reporters, she asked, `` Did you hear her??\n",
      "In the silence that followed, Miriam walked close to Mrs. Cupply, who drew back a step on her side of the gate.\n",
      "Then, with staring eyes and lips drawn thin, Miriam said to the young woman, `` You are ugly -- uglier than you used to be, and you were always very ugly.\n",
      "and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art.\n",
      "As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all, Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him;;\n",
      "she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska, the Fighting Liberal, from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard.\n",
      "Then, after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce, Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating, `` I will never leave Mr. Wright''.\n",
      "Under this kind of pressure, it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers.\n",
      "Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly, but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters when he was asked, one morning on arrival in Chicago, what he thought of the city as a whole.\n",
      "Cried Wright, showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920's.\n",
      "`` This is a horrible way to live'', Wright went on.\n",
      "He was then asked for a solution of the difficulty, and began to talk trenchant sense, though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner.\n",
      "If you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams.\n",
      "After all, that's the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy''.\n",
      "The first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning, as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the Old Testament.\n",
      "A storm did take place that night, and fortunately enough, it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames.\n",
      "at any rate, heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes, and fused the K'ang-si pottery to cinders.\n",
      "Wright set his loss at $200,000, a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined, and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed.\n",
      "In spite of the disaster, Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort, in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm, that came to nothing.\n",
      "how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do??\n",
      "As he made plans for the new Taliesin, Wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths, and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp.\n",
      "Years were to pass before these plans came off the paper, and Wright was justified in thinking, as the projects failed, that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to Taliesin.\n",
      "And now there was some question as to his continued residence there.\n",
      "Billy Koch, who had once worked for Wright as a chauffeur, gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin.\n",
      "This might put Wright in such a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin;;\n",
      "nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills, useless hotel bills, and useless doctor's bills'', he could more quickly provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris, as she preferred.\n",
      "Miriam sniffed at this, and complained that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters.\n",
      "His reply was, `` Everything that has been printed derogatory to you, purporting to have come from me, was a betrayal, and nothing yet has been printed which I have sanctioned''.\n",
      "What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made, which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity''.\n",
      "From her California headquarters, Miriam fired back, `` I shall never divorce Mr. Wright, to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff''.\n",
      "Then Miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending, and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, with the understanding that Wright would not contest it.\n",
      "The Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's ability to meet the terms.\n",
      "He said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end, and that the bank would accept a mortgage on Taliesin to help bring this about.\n",
      "Miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman, Olga, will not be in luxury while I am scraping along''.\n",
      "This exhausted Wright's patience, and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite.\n",
      "`` Volstead laws, speed laws, divorce laws'', he said, `` as they now stand, demoralize the individual, make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another, and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd.\n",
      "If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning, I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland, to do what I can.\n",
      "I realize, in taking this stand, just what it means to me and mine''.\n",
      "Here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness, and continued, `` It means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people, making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me''.\n",
      "Next day, word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce;;\n",
      "More likely, you simply told yourself, as you handed us the book, that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation.\n",
      "For pride's sake, I will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul.\n",
      "Besides, that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood.\n",
      "But what you could not know, of course, was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come, if not of age, then into a bright, taut semblance of it.\n",
      "I do not suppose you ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald, living or dead, and moreover I do not suppose that, even if you had, his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval.\n",
      "Neither his appetites, his exacerbations, nor his despair were kin to yours.\n",
      "But he was no man in the moon to me.\n",
      "Although his tender nights were not the ones I dreamed of, nor was it for yachts, sports cars, tall drinks, and swimming pools, nor yet for money or what money buys that I burned, I too was burning and watching myself burn.\n",
      "It was symbolized( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image) by that self-consuming, elegiac candle of Edna St. Vincent Millay's, that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us, but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening, let alone the night.\n",
      "One should not, of course, pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on.\n",
      "Yet this passion for passion, now that I look back on it with passion spent, seems somewhat overblown and operatic, though as a diva Miss Millay perfectly controlled her notes.\n",
      "Only what else was she singing but the old Song of Songs, that most ancient of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves??\n",
      "Perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us, temporarily anyway, the sleeping poet, and in poets can discover their immortality, is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest??\n",
      "One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend;;\n",
      "In any case, Miss Millay's sweet-throated bitterness, her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love, her constant and wonderfully tragic posture, so unlike that of Fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props, drew from the me that I was when I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.\n",
      "But all this, I am well aware, is the bel canto of love, and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened, I know well enough that it was not.\n",
      "If I am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love, I will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale.\n",
      "Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have, of course, no way of knowing, nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know, for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest, more scandalizing, more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger.\n",
      "At the same time, I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign, since theirs is a science of paradox: if one hates, they say it is because one loves;;\n",
      "and according to them, whatever one fancies one feels, what one feels in fact is the opposite.\n",
      "Well, normally abnormal or normally normal, neurotic or merely fastidious( do the tea-leaf readers, by the way, allow psyches to have moral taste??\n",
      "), I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion.\n",
      "You probably would not remember, since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I, much less their intensity, one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm.\n",
      "We had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display, when you suddenly turned to me, looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats, and with your nervous `` ahem''!!\n",
      "I fled, however, not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things'' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself( despite, I may now say, the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle, yes, on principle, and in cold blood) because I was resolved, as a modern woman, not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat.\n",
      "I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal.\n",
      "What I fled from was my fear of what, unwittingly, you might betray, without meaning to, about my father and yourself.\n",
      "While my memory holds with relentless tenacity, as I cannot too often stress, to my wrongs, when it comes to my shames, it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them.\n",
      "Just as I was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf of love, memory, displeased at being asked to yield its unsavory secrets, dashed ahead of me, calling back over its shoulder: `` Skip it.\n",
      "It is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance.\n",
      "If to be innocent is to be helpless, then I had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start.\n",
      "Helpless in that sense I can never be again.\n",
      "However, I confess my hope that I will be innocent again, not with a pristine, accidental innocence, but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone.\n",
      "For innocence, of all the graces of the spirit, is I believe the one most to be prayed for.\n",
      "Although it is constantly made to look foolish( too simple to come in out of the rain, people say, who have found in the innocent an impediment), it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks.\n",
      "It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best, and when they seem worst it overlooks them.\n",
      "To innocence, a word given is a word that will be kept.\n",
      "Instinctively, innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by.\n",
      "But when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust, innocence can falter, since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it.\n",
      "But I insist upon believing that even when it is lost, it may, like paradise, be regained.\n",
      "However, it was not of innocence in general that I was speaking, but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love.\n",
      "To you, for instance, the word innocence, in this connotation, probably retained its Biblical, or should I say technical sense, and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear by saying that I lost -- or rather handed over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled, and in fact by oath required, to hand it over along with what other goods and bads I had.\n",
      "But to me innocence is far less tangible.\n",
      "I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my trust in you, but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved, through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing, nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking, let alone with love.\n",
      "I knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time I acquired it;;\n",
      "today, these many years later, after all the temptations resisted or yielded to, the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured, I call it corrupting still.\n",
      "You, I could swear to it, remained innocent in this sense until the end.\n",
      "Moreover, because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmother's part, and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow, what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person, what you bent your whole will, sensibility, and intelligence upon, was to be a lady.\n",
      "There was, of course, more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than the sine qua non of her virtue.\n",
      "A lady, you made clear to me both by precept and example, never raised her voice or slumped in her chair, never failed in social tact( in heaven, for instance, would not mention St. John the Baptist's head), never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company, never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture, never indulged in public scenes or private confidences, never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering, never gossiped or maligned, never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself.\n",
      "Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties.\n",
      "After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln, Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him.\n",
      "Each song or ditty was prefaced by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had, musical arrangement, and most of the chorus and verses.\n",
      "As Sandburg said at the time: `` It is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to the Appalachian Mountains, it is as modern as skyscrapers, the Volstead Act, and the latest oil well gusher''.\n",
      "Two things contribute to his popularity.\n",
      "He has his own system of shorthand, devised by abbreviations: `` humility'' will be `` humly'', `` with'' will be `` w'', and `` that'' will be `` tt''.\n",
      "It is a mistake, however, to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop.\n",
      "It is not easy to become Segovia's pupil.\n",
      "I found that this precocious, grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught.\n",
      "Just as in the case of every prodigy child, we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the strenuous exercises I inflicted on him.\n",
      "One cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar.\n",
      "I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy.\n",
      "He is proud of having Segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him titled `` The Guitar''.\n",
      "Carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument.\n",
      "`` A portable companion always ready to go where you go -- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet meditation''.\n",
      "The New York Herald Tribune's photographer, Ira Rosenberg, tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a picture of Carl playing a guitar.\n",
      "Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one.\n",
      "They went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller of 1162 Sixth Avenue.\n",
      "`` Mr. Miller was in the shop'', the Herald Tribune story related, `` but was reluctant to have anybody's picture taken inside, because his business was too' confidential' for pictures.\n",
      "`` He wanted Mr. Sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop, but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully.\n",
      "While the picture was taken, Mr. Miller's disposition to be generous to Mr. Sandburg increased to the point where he advised,' I won't even charge you the one dollar rental fee'''.\n",
      "When someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a celebrity, Carl said, `` A celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity''.\n",
      "Lloyd Lewis wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916, Sandburg was making $27.50 a week writing features for the Day Book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants.\n",
      "Carl thought the question over slowly and answered: `` I know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation, I know that''.\n",
      "That was all he had to say.\n",
      "In answer to a New York Times query on what is fame( `` Thoughts On Fame'', October 23, 1960), Carl said: `` Fame is a figment of a pigment.\n",
      "Carl has been married to Paula for fifty-three years, and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife.\n",
      "`` You are the' Peoples' Poet''' was her appraisal in 1908, and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband's career.\n",
      "Even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts.\n",
      "The only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a Grecian sense.\n",
      "As the Sandburg goat herd increased, she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them.\n",
      "By the time Lilian had been graduated from public school, her parents were doing quite well.\n",
      "But her father was not enthusiastic about sending young Paula to high school.\n",
      "The parents compromised, however, on a convent school and Paula went to Ursuline Academy in London, Ontario.\n",
      "She was pious, too, once kneeling through the night from Holy Thursday to Good Friday, despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl.\n",
      "Paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel.\n",
      "She had come to a decision.\n",
      "If there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote her life to religion, it was now dispelled.\n",
      "`` I felt that I must devote myself to the' outside' world''.\n",
      "She passed the entrance examinations to the University of Illinois, but during the year at Urbana felt more important events transpired at the University of Chicago.\n",
      "Carl and Paula met in Milwaukee in 1907 during Paula's Christmas holiday visit to her parents.\n",
      "Victor Berger, the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress, had asked Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English.\n",
      "Carl, who was stationed in Appleton, Wisconsin, organizing for the Social Democrats, was in Berger's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar.\n",
      "Paula says that even though Carl's letters usually began, `` Dear Miss Steichen'', there was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband and wife.\n"

      "Hammarskjold's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion, at best.\n",
      "Gross's, being `` outside'' the U.N. applied only to a physical state, not an objective one.\n",
      "But by the time the papers were finally disposed of, the group had informed the world of its purpose, its recommendations, and its belief that Paul Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind.\n",
      "Shortly the group would issue its report to the Secretary General, recommending Paul Bang-Jensen's dismissal from the United Nations.\n",
      "The contents of this 195-page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about.\n",
      "Ernest A. Gross leaned back in his chair and told Peter Marshall how Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold had, on December 4, 1957, called him in as a private lawyer to review Bang-Jensen's conduct `` relating to his association with the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary''.\n",
      "He had always done well.\n",
      "Never well known, but he had done his work competently.\n",
      "`` You know'', the lawyer said, `` it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back''.\n",
      "`` Mr. Gross, your report says that' our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice Mr. Bang-Jensen's rights as a staff member.\n",

      "Supposing you or I were being accused in this manner, and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work.\n",
      "No organization can carry on like that.\n",
      "`` What I'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your Committee''.\n",
      "`` For instance, regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation.\n",
      "You know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was' to convey its views, suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General.\n",
      "In his own words, Bang-Jensen' took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public.\n",
      "He claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was' prejudicial to his position'''.\n",
      "`` I thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end.\n",
      "It was getting so that we, the Committee, were being tried.\n",
      "`` The reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list.\n",
      "The January fifteen report recommended that Bang-Jensen be instructed to burn the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a U.N. Security Officer''.\n",
      "`` How about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that??\n",
      "Bang-Jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term' aberrant conduct' was not libelous.\n",
      "`` The entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list, since many in the press were querying the U.N. about it.\n",
      "Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession.\n",
      "`` It was foolish of him to keep them, whatever they were.\n",
      "We attempted to conclude this, and did so by having the papers burned.\n",
      "Hammarskjold believes the U.N. is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way.\n",
      "`` Mr. Gross, concerning the formation of your Committee, there's the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the U.N. in the past;;\n",
      "Could you comment on that''??\n",
      "`` I've served as a counsel for the U.N. for some years, specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular U.N. legal staff might not be equipped to handle.\n",
      "`` Why, Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing Andersen, trying to check them out.\n",
      "Gross pointed to the Manley story.\n",
      "He probably didn't mean to write it this way, or maybe he did.\n",
      "That implies that Shann was on the enemy side.\n",
      "`` The case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further errors in the report.\n",
      "' I've found errors and I want you to look them over.\n",
      "So once again Shann had to argue with him about this.\n",
      "And after all this, Shann went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up''.\n",
      "It was a good report, he did all he could to make it a good report.\n",
      "When I speak of how Shann felt, I know well.\n",
      "I think you are being unfair to take these things up now.\n",
      "It appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian situation.\n",
      "It takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact''.\n",
      "from the home of his friend, Henrik Kauffmann, in Washington, D.C., Paul Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December 9, 1957, to Ernest Gross.\n",
      "`` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character, and I therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make adequate preparation''.\n",
      "Ernest Gross replied the next day, putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest.\n",
      "It wished to pursue, in the course of this review, questions arising from the body of material already in its possession.\n",
      "`` We were requested by the Secretary General, as I understand it, to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant, and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat.\n",
      "Peter Marshall noted that Bang-Jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the Gross group as `` unfortunate experiences'', and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel.\n",
      "At last they concluded that the heavy, full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise.\n",
      "Finally, tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise, they decided to dance instead.\n",
      "She could not face coffee or tea without milk, and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship.\n",
      "By now she was sure she was going to have a baby, deciding it would be born in India or Burma that November.\n",
      "The crew of the Caravan never failed to amaze Ann, who during her stay in Salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language.\n",
      "Even the first wave of homesickness had passed, although there were moments when Captain Heard pointed out on his compass the direction of Bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart.\n",
      "As for Adoniram, she found him to be `` the kindest'' of husbands.\n",
      "Sometimes a ship would be sighted and the Caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck.\n",
      "As warmer temperatures were encountered Ann and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water.\n",
      "They were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope;;\n",
      "At this time Harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in India was sent to her mother:\n",
      "I have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel, and the almost intolerable smell after the rain, that I have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days.\n",
      "But I have been blest with excellent spirits, and to-day have been running about the deck, and dancing in our room for exercise, as well as ever''.\n",
      "He had brought it along to continue during the voyage.\n",
      "There was one particular word that troubled his conscience.\n",
      "As was only natural he confided his searchings to Ann, conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own Congregationalists were wrong and the Baptists right.\n",
      "By this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband, yet the uncomfortable fact remained: the American Congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the Far East and paying their salaries.\n",
      "How embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed Congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace Baptist teachings!!\n",
      "`` If you become a Baptist, I will not'', Ann informed her husband, but sweeping her threat aside Adoniram continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself.\n",
      "and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel;;\n",
      "Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds.\n",
      "Captain Heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the Bay of Bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters.\n",
      "Alas, to Ann's consternation, his language while thus employed left much to be desired.\n",
      "He swore so loudly at the top of his voice, that she didn't get any sleep all the next night.\n",
      "Running across the deck, which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten, they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore, each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other.\n",
      "She was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in Haverhill.\n",
      "The Indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly, even if she was suitably shocked, according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared, to find them `` naked, except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle''.\n",
      "Founded August 24, 1690 by Job Charnock of the East India Company, and commonly called `` The City of Palaces'', it seemed a vast and elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson.\n",
      "Harriet's mouth watered with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved milk and fresh bread.\n",
      "Ann, pleased to see her friend happy, was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of Captain Heard had sent on board for their enjoyment.\n",
      "Cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of `` a rich pear''.\n",
      "The first act of Adoniram and Samuel on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station, a necessity when landing in East India Company territory.\n",
      "On the way they tried to discover all they could about Burma, and they were disturbed to find that Michael Symes's book had not presented an altogether true picture.\n",
      "He had failed to realize that the Burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself.\n",
      "They were in fact quietly laughing at him, for their King wished to have nothing to do with the Western world.\n",
      "Although after much trouble he did manage to get it back, he discovered there was no trade to be had.\n",
      "All Captain Gibault took back to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum.\n",
      "A year later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy.\n",
      "After that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma.\n",
      "The Burmese appeared to have little knowledge of British power or any idea of trade.\n",
      "As for missionaries, even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the Christian faith to the Burmans.\n",
      "Unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate.\n",
      "`` Go back to America or any other place'', well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them, `` but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads''.\n",
      "When he discovered they had received from the Company's Court of Directors no permission to live in India, coupled with the fact that they were Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert `` the heathen'', he became more belligerent than ever.\n",
      "They explained that they desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could be found.\n",
      "The reasons for the Whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government, their delight at the prospect of a new war, their hopes of having the Tories hanged, and so on.\n",
      "As for the author of the Englishman, Mrs. Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the Protestant cause should be left to `` Ridpath, Dick Steele, and their Associates, with the Apostles of Young Man's Coffee-House''.\n",
      "On December 21, the day that the Irish House of Commons petitioned for removal of Sir Constantine Phipps, their Tory Lord Chancellor, Molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of Phipps by Convocation: `` They that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also''.\n",
      "Upon complaints from the Lower House of Convocation to the House of Lords, he was removed from the Privy Council, his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy.\n",
      "Steele, who had earlier praised Molesworth in Tatler No. 189, now defended him in Englishman No. 46, depicting his removal as a setback to the Constitution.\n",
      "Swift, in the Dublin edition of A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's Introduction, indicated his feelings by including Molesworth, along with Toland, Tindal, and Collins, in the group of those who, like Burnet, are engaged in attacking all Convocations of the clergy.\n",
      "In the same way he coupled Molesworth and Wharton in a letter to Archbishop King, and he had earlier described him as `` the worst of them'' in some `` Observations'' on the Irish Privy Council submitted to Oxford.\n",
      "A month later, in The Publick Spirit Of The Whigs, he used Steele's defense of Molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy, calling Steele's position an affront to the `` whole Convocation of Ireland''.\n",
      "The preliminaries ended with the publication of Steele's Crisis on January 19, and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace.\n",
      "In answer to The Crisis, Swift produced The Publick Spirit Of The Whigs, his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend.\n",
      "By this time, as we shall see, the Tories were already planning to `` punish'' Steele for his political writing by expelling him from the House of Commons.\n",
      "Hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation, said to have reached 40,000, and if one may judge by the reaction of Swift and other government writers, the work must have had considerable impact.\n",
      "Steele's main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a Stuart Restoration.\n",
      "To this end, the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the Revolution to defend England against the `` Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince''.\n",
      "In his comment on these laws Steele sounds all the usual notes of current Whig propaganda, ranging from a criticism of the Tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of Marlborough;;\n",
      "but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the Tories, `` our Popish or Jacobite Party'', pose an immediate threat to Church and State.\n",
      "Treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian Succession, he complains, are allowed to pass unnoticed.\n",
      "In this connection, Swift, too, is drawn in for attack: `` The Author of The Conduct Of The Allies has dared to drop Insinuations about altering the Succession''.\n",
      "In his effort to stir the public from its lethargy, Steele goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a Stuart Restoration, and, with rousing rhetoric, he asserts that the only preservation from these `` Terrours'' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited.\n",
      "`` It is no time'', he writes, `` to talk with Hints and Innuendos, but openly and honestly to profess our Sentiments before our Enemies have compleated and put their Designs in Execution against us''.\n",
      "Steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good, since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the House.\n",
      "In a few months the Duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the Protestant Succession.\n",
      "At the order of the Dowager Electress, the Hanoverian agents, supported by the Whig leaders, demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the Duke to England to sit in Parliament, thus further insuring the Succession by establishing a Hanoverian Prince in England before the Queen's death.\n",
      "Anne was furious, and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused.\n",
      "Oxford, realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ, took the opposite view, for which the Queen never forgave him.\n",
      "Accordingly the request was granted, but the Elector himself, who had not been consulted by his mother, rejected the proposal and recalled his agent Schutz, whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the Hanoverian interest to suffer and had made Oxford's dismissal more likely than ever.\n",
      "A few days after this Englishman appeared, Defoe reported to Oxford that Steele was expected to move in Parliament that the Duke be called over;;\n",
      "Defoe then commented, `` If they Could Draw that young Gentleman into Their Measures They would show themselves quickly, for they are not asham'd to Say They want only a head to Make a beginning''.\n",
      "The final issue of the Englishman, No. 57 for February 15, ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet, entitled The Englishman: Being the Close of the Paper So-called.\n",
      "Steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the Englishman;;\n",
      "Thus he complains, with considerable justice, that the Tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments.\n",
      "His birth, education, and fortune, he says, have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an Englishman, and he assures the reader that `` whoever talks with me, is speaking to a Gentleman born''.\n",
      "As notable examples of this abuse, he quotes passages from the Examiner, `` that Destroyer of all things'', and The Character of Richard Steele, which he here attributes to Swift.\n",
      "His point is simply that the Tories have showered him with personal satire, despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the Sovereign.\n",
      "He claims, too, that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` Revolution Principles'' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties.\n",
      "It purports to be a letter from Steele to a friend at court, who, in Miss Blanchard's opinion, could only be meant as Swift.\n",
      "by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the Church despite their own education and manner of life -- a gibe, in other words, at the `` Presbyterianism'' in Harley's family and at Bolingbroke's reputed impiety.\n",
      "The Tory leaders, he insinuates, are cynically using the Church as a political `` By-word'' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power.\n",
      "This is the principal point made in this final section of Englishman No. 57, and it caps Steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the Tories as a `` Church Party'' supported by the body of the clergy.\n",
      "Next, Steele turns his attention to the `` Courtier'' he is addressing.\n",
      "He explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers, but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his Sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition.\n",
      "If `` Jack the Courtier'' is really to be taken as Swift, the following remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of parties and its effect on their friendship: `` I assure you, dear Jack, when I first found out such an Allay in you, as makes you of so malleable a Constitution, that you may be worked into any Form an Artificer pleases, I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much longer''.\n",
      "He closes his `` letter'' by demanding that Dunkirk be demolished, that the Pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of England, and that the Queen and the House of Hanover come to a better understanding.\n",
      "The last point was soon to be included in the `` seditious'' remarks used against him in Parliament.\n",
      "The Examiner, during Steele's trial a month later, printed an answer from the `` Courtier'' addressed to `` R. S.'' at Button's coffee-house.\n",
      "He reviews Steele's entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends.\n",
      "Once more, in other words, Steele is said to be indebted to Swift for his `` wit'';;\n",
      "In The Publick Spirit of the Whigs, it may be noted, Swift himself contemptuously dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court: `` I suppose by the Style of old Friend, and the like, it must be some Body there of his own Level;;\n",
      "By now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from Tory papers and pamphlets, and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament.\n",
      "On the very day that the parliamentary session began, another `` Infamous Libel'' appeared, entitled A Letter From The Facetious Dr. Andrew Tripe, At Bath, To The Venerable Nestor Ironside.\n",
      "in the opening paragraph, too, Steele is accused of extreme egotism, of giving `` himself the preference to all the learned, his contemporaries, from Dr. Swift himself, even down to Poet Cr--spe of the Customhouse''.\n",
      "When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944, it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer, begun some years before.\n",
      "Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs, Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on.\n",
      "Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled Hot Nocturne.\n",
      "It purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians, their aims, their problems -- the tug-of-war between the `` pure'' and the `` commercial'' -- and seemed a promising vehicle, for the two men shared a common interest in jazz.\n",
      "His father, George A. Mercer, was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh Mercer, who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747.\n",
      "By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the call.\n",
      "One day he followed the Irish Jasper Greens, the town band, to a picnic and spent the entire day listening, while his family spent the day looking.\n",
      "The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy.\n",
      "both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home.\n",
      "With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet.\n",
      "Still, he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School, near Orange, Virginia, where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well.\n",
      "If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been, Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect.\n"

      "This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since.\n",

      "When he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking for singers to replace the Rhythm Boys, Mercer applied and got the job, `` not for my voice, I'm sure, but because I could write songs and material generally''.\n",
      "He had yet to meet Harold Arlen, for although they had `` collaborated'' on `` Satan's Li'l Lamb'', Mercer and Harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them.\n",
      "The lyric, Mercer remembers, was tailored to fit the unusual melody.\n",
      "The countrywide success of `` Lazybones'' and `` And The Angels Sing'' could only lead to Hollywood, where, besides Harold Arlen, Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren, Jimmy Van Heusen, Richard Whiting, Walter Donaldson, Jerome Kern, and Arthur Schwartz.\n",

      "The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which Koehler set the words `` There'll be no more work;;\n",
      "The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied the American-Negro Suite and said of it, `` Of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music, these six songs by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest.\n",
      "Thoroughly modern in treatment, they are at the same time, full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average' Broadway Spirituals' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the' Amen Corner',' judgement Day,' Gabriel's Horn, and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure.\n",
      "I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole.\n",
      "It was here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's party.\n",
      "A much larger room, adjacent to the lavatory, served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet.\n",
      "That unused room was large enough for -- well, say an elephant could get into it and, as a matter of fact, an elephant did.\n",
      "It so happened that sports writer Arthur Robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence.\n",
      "Mr. Herford's appearance was that of a frustrated gnome.\n",
      "Robinson asked Herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards.\n",
      "In the jakes, after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed, Mr. Herford went to the adjoining facility.\n",
      "The artist-author said nothing, but stood to one side.\n",

      "May I say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb -- the younger Pliny's, if memory serves me -- which, translated freely from the archaic Latin, says,' The more haste, the less peed'''.\n",
      "the Honorable Robert Wagner, Sr., at that time a justice of the New York Supreme Court, was on the reception committee.\n",
      "When, in my enthusiasm, I proposed the party, my city editor( who disliked the club and many of its members) tried to block my participation in the gala event.\n",
      "Even earlier than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit the club's Reporter.\n",
      "He had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried.\n",
      "It was said that the Hetman plotted to take over the entire Hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course, the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to Mr. Hearst.\n",
      "He also disliked Runyon, for no good reason other than the fact that the Demon's talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the Hetman's say-so or his supervision.\n",
      "Arthur `` Bugs'' Baer wrote to me just recently, `` Vic wanted to die in harness, with his head towards the wagon.\n",
      "Watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother, blossoms bought with Vic's allowance to him.\n",
      "Then he would get to his feet, as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers, and say almost invariably, `` Gentlemen, this is an amazing story!!\n",
      "One day he assigned me to lay bare a `` plot'' by the Duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in Cuba.\n",
      "He said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.\n",
      "When I returned to make my report, the Hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission.\n",
      "He was busy, he said, in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation.\n",
      "And I was to go to work on that odd matter.\n",
      "The Hetman had a strong liking for a story, any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods.\n",
      "One day I tired of following the Hetman's advice of `` shadowing'' and of the `` ring-around-the-rosie'' approach to a report that Enrico Caruso had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the Central Park monkey house.\n",
      "I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and to `` Bugs'' Baer.\n",
      "We fashioned beards, put them on, and reported to the Hetman at the city desk.\n",
      "`` We are ready for your next mysterious assignment'', said Mr. Baer to the Hetman.\n",
      "`` Where to, sir''??\n",
      "Just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder.\n",
      "The Hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it.\n",
      "He paused for a moment to look at me, then went on to the city desk to deliver his `` Today'' column.\n",
      "I thought it expedient to take off my derby, my glasses, and the beard;;\n",
      "and also to change telephones.\n",
      "I managed to do this by the time the great A.B. returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist.\n",
      "In the conduct of these and many other campaigns, the Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.\n",
      "It seems to me now, in a long backward glance, that many of the Hetman's conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of Mr. Hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day.\n",
      "One finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol, W.R. Hearst.\n",
      "The unfinished note, written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope, and addressed to the coroner, makes one wonder about many things: `` God forgive me for everything.\n",
      "Much to Damon Runyon's amazement, as well as my own, I got along splendidly with the Hetman;;\n",
      "that is, until I became an editor, hence, in his eyes, a rival.\n",
      "It was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists.\n",
      "I would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement.\n",
      "Somehow I think that Watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe, Colonel Van Hamm, wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.\n",
      "I remember one day when Mr. Hearst( and I never knew why he liked me, either) sent the Hetman a telegram: `` Please find some more reporters like that young man from Denver''.\n",
      "Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm.\n",
      "`` Don't bother to look any further.\n",
      "I used to go with Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment, to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of statues, paintings, and books and drink Oriental coffee while Watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable.\n",
      "If she were not at home, Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there.\n",
      "Sometimes, Mrs. Coolidge would close herself in the Green Suite on the second floor, and play the piano she had brought to the White House.\n",
      "Mama knew she was playing her son's favorite pieces and feeling close to him, and did not disturb her.\n",
      "All the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic loss, even though the President tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.\n",
      "A little boy came to give the President his personal condolences, and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in.\n",
      "Backstairs, the maids cried a little over that, and the standing invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge.\n",
      "He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips.\n",
      "One shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it, so she draped it over the banister on the second floor, and it hung over the stairway.\n",
      "The President used to look at it with a ghost of a smile.\n",
      "At night, when Mama would turn back the covers, she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night.\n",
      "Mama always felt that the collection symbolized Mrs. Coolidge's wish for a little girl.\n",
      "Among the dolls was one that meant very much to the First Lady, who would pick it up and look at it often.\n",
      "It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist.\n",
      "An accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for Mrs. Coolidge's first granddaughter.\n",
      "Mama knew this doll was meant to help Mrs. Coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future.\n",
      "It was part of Little Jack's work to look after the dogs.\n",
      "To get him to pose, Mrs. Coolidge would feed him candy, so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did.\n",
      "I would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress Mrs. Coolidge is wearing in this painting.\n",
      "I still have the dress, and I hope to give it to the Smithsonian Institution as a memento, or, as I more fondly hope, to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the Presidents -- if I can get it organized.\n",
      "But to get back to the Coolidge household, Mrs. Coolidge so obviously loved dogs, that the public sent her more dogs -- Calamity Jane, Timmy, and Blackberry.\n",
      "He showed them what to do, and taught them how to keep the maids around the White House in a state of terror.\n",
      "Mama didn't know what to do -- whether to tell on Rob Roy or not -- since she had the ear of Mrs. Coolidge more than the other maids.\n",
      "then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear.\n",
      "His signal was for the other dogs to come running, but it was also the signal for Mama and the other maids to watch out.\n",
      "Rob Roy was self-appointed to accompany the President to his office every morning.\n",
      "Rob Roy was well aware of the importance of this mission, and he would walk in front of the President, looking neither to the right nor to the left.\n",
      "All the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to the dining room.\n",
      "When Prudence and Blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room, they were tied to the radiator with their leashes, and they would cry.\n",
      "Mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the First Family returned.\n",
      "Finally, Mama did mention to Mrs. Coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs, and then Mrs. Coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone, even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.\n",
      "Mama was now the first maid to Mrs. Coolidge, because Catherine, the previous first maid, had become ill and died.\n",
      "Every First Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship.\n",
      "They seemed to be at the White House half the time.\n",
      "Speaking of breakfast, the President inaugurated a new custom -- that of conducting business at the breakfast table.\n",
      "The word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part.\n",
      "A new bill had been passed under Harding that designated the Government, rather than the President, as the tab-lifter for official meals.\n",
      "So the President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government officials to attend.\n",
      "He caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate.\n",
      "Mama said that if Presidents were supposed to be colorful, Mr. Coolidge certainly made a good president.\n",
      "He knew exactly how to be colorful!!\n",
      "The White House had chewing gum until it could chew no more, and every Christmas, Mr. Wrigley sent the President a check for $100, to be divided among all the help.\n",
      "You can imagine that he got pretty good service.\n",
      "Another good friend of the Coolidges' was George B. Harvey, who was the Ambassador to Great Britain from 1921 to 1923.\n",
      "He had been a friend of the Hardings, and continued to be invited by the Coolidges.\n",
      "The first royalty whom Mama ever waited on in the White House was Queen Marie of Rumania, who came to a State dinner given in her honor on October 21, 1926.\n",
      "Mama was very patriotic, and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the White House.\n",
      "She would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening.\n",
      "She used to tell me, `` When I stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way, I have the wonderful, safe feeling that Americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows''.\n",
      "Even when Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning for her son, she reached out to help other people in trouble.\n",
      "Taking a personal interest, she had the doctor assigned to the White House, Dr. James Coupal, look Emmett over.\n",
      "As a result, he was sent to a hospital in Arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to Washington to work in the Government service.\n",
      "But again, there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy Washington weather, and he had to return to the dry climate of the West to live and work.\n",
      "Mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors.\n",
      "The President helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started.\n",
      "It was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs, and, just as the First Lady stepped off the last tread, Mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the Blue Room to greet her guests with the President.\n",
      "Mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone, and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night.\n",
      "She had stood at the bottom of the stairs, as usual, when Mrs. Coolidge came down, in the same dress that is now in the Smithsonian, to greet her guests.\n",
      "Mama stooped down to fix the train, but there was no train there!!\n",
      "She looked up and saw that, without knowing it, Mrs. Coolidge was holding it aloft.\n",
      "Mrs. Coolidge looked down, saw Mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor.\n",
      "Impressive as this enumeration is, it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of Jews, collectively or individually, that have been attested by their Gentile environment.\n",
      "It is reasonable to affirm two propositions: Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things to all men;;\n",
      "some Jews have in fact been all things to all men.\n",
      "And so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph.\n",
      "The working test of `` the facts'' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations.\n",
      "Granted, such `` functional'' images are subject to human error;;\n",
      "they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error.\n",
      "if so, he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future.\n",
      "He may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs.\n",
      "To some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments.\n",
      "The anti-Semitism of Hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of Lueger's politically successful Christian socialist movement in Vienna.\n",
      "But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda and record.\n",
      "After allowing for group exposures, it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism.\n",
      "Modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.\n",
      "The foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it.\n",
      "Undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile conceptions of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality.\n",
      "Many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal.\n",
      "Speaking as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy.\n",
      "Since we can neither undo nor redo the past, we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow.\n",
      "In this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local, national, and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect, large or small, upon Gentile-Jewish relations.\n",
      "What are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized??\n",
      "What policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values??\n",
      "It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range.\n",
      "The discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy.\n",
      "As a groundwork for the proposal I give some attention to the first task enumerated above, the clarification of goal.\n",
      "My reply is that I associate myself with all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity.\n",
      "Within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the Jews depend upon which Jewish identity is involved, as well as upon the nature of the claim, the characteristics of the claimant, the justifications proposed, and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act.\n",
      "If Jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal, it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship.\n",
      "When decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion.\n",
      "Community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states.\n",
      "The decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups.\n",
      "We know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the Jew.\n",
      "Many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of Gentile and Jew.\n",
      "So far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned, categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in Jewish-Gentile relationships;;\n",
      "claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties.\n",
      "It is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving Jews and Gentiles during coming years.\n",
      "In conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage, taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration.\n",
      "It is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate;;\n",
      "When we consider the disorganized state of the world community, and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as Jews, it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill.\n",
      "At such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off''.\n",
      "By the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact, with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified.\n",
      "Among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control.\n",
      "We are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society;;\n",
      "A truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best.\n",
      "As more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected.\n",
      "Now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach;;\n",
      "In any case I do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions.\n",
      "I assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small, and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others.\n",
      "Let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method `` psychoanalytic'', for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by Sigmund Freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities.\n",
      "For what we propose, however, a psychoanalyst is not necessary, even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself.\n",
      "but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind.\n",
      "The relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said, whether he responds with anger or applause.\n",
      "The symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.\n",
      "An advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself, resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the Jew.\n",
      "There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself, reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else.\n",
      "Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important.\n",
      "Moreover, if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work, he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking;;\n",
      "if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work, he is helping them to achieve their own identity.\n",
      "The second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today.\n",
      "And find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species.\n",
      "The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be, like the models he sees, even more like everybody else.\n",
      "And this, I think, holds for values as well as life styles.\n",
      "One would need to test this proposition carefully;;\n",
      "Scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic, too.\n",
      "It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to some code of `` right'' and `` wrong''.\n",
      "I do not know that this is true;;\n",
      "I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life, or, for the theologians of course, to the influence of religion.\n",
      "Still, it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong;;\n",
      "Probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience, which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature, but the contents of conscience, the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available.\n",
      "This is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it.\n",
      "In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover, how to behave, how to think about this new experience, how to exercise restraint.\n",
      "Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose, dedication, mission, significance.\n",
      "This, no doubt, is part of what Gilbert Seldes implies when he says of the arts, `` They give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense''.\n",
      "Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function, that is, a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, close and immediate or generalized.\n",
      "Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation.\n",
      "A need so deeply planted, asking for direction, so to speak, is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature.\n",
      "The terms `` renewal'' and `` refreshed'', which often come up in aesthetic discussion, seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal'' of purpose and a `` refreshed'' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry, drama, and fiction.\n",
      "The notion of `` inspiration'' is somehow cognate to this feeling.\n",
      "How literature does this, or for whom, is certainly not clear, but the content, form, and language of the `` message'', as well as the source, would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose.\n",
      "One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion.\n",
      "The idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view, Plato's notion of the arousal of emotion.\n",
      "A third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts, giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals.\n",
      "It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea.\n",
      "If art is to release us from these postulated things( things we must think symbolically about) and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy, it must sever its connection with these common sense entities''.\n",
      "I take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it.\n"

      "A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these.\n",
      "But there is one in particular which, it seems to me, deserves special attention.\n",
      "In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage, more troublesome, and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate.\n",
      "The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way.\n",
      "William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, it seems to me, have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected: `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem) and if it is to talk of anger and murder( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification, compounding, or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections at all.\n",
      "Something indirect, mixed, reconciling, tensional might well be the stratagem, the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions'' of these emotions, without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement''.\n",
      "I mean something more like Freud's concept of the utility of `` play'' to a small child: he plays `` house'' or `` doctor'' or `` fireman'' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences, reliving them imaginatively until they are under control.\n",
      "In B. M. Spinley's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London, a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification, a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience.\n",
      "It is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.\n",
      "In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions, particularly with respect to the sense of harmony, or relief of tension, or sense of `` a transformed inner nature'' which may occur, a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required.\n",
      "In the calm which follows the reading of a poem, for example, is the effect produced by the enforced quiet, by the musical quality of words and rhythm, by the sentiments or sense of the poem, by the associations with earlier readings, if it is familiar, by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate, by the diversion of attention, by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal, by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden, or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words??\n",
      "One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide.\n",
      "Among other things it means perception, discrimination, sensitivity to subtle differences.\n",
      "Both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged.\n",
      "The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars, political candidates, or female beauty.\n",
      "Along these lines, the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen.\n",
      "But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap.\n",
      "I would say, too, that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth.\n",
      "I use this term to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs, a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts, and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling.\n",
      "In fact, I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide, continuous, and properly guided exposure to literary art.\n",
      "The late R. G. Collingwood, a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature, once wrote ``::\n",
      "We are all, though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it, in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue, or even Shakespeare and Titian.\n",
      "but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries, and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place.\n",
      "The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art, to despise and dislike the art of the recent past, and wholly to ignore everything else''.\n",
      "One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public, of the newspaper critic, and of the creative artist himself.\n",
      "Of course, it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene.\n",
      "He will frequently return to it.\n",
      "When we assert the value of such study, we find ourselves committed to an important assumption.\n",
      "Most students of literature, whether they call themselves scholars or critics, are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them.\n",
      "Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding.\n",
      "This understanding, of course, may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical.\n",
      "But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form, `` texture'', or technique.\n",
      "It is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight.\n",
      "But, in general, we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other.\n",
      "At this point a working definition of idea is in order, although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed.\n",
      "The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience.\n",
      "It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy.\n",
      "In this essay, we are, along with most historians, interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas, that are so to speak `` writ large'' in history of literature where they recur continually.\n",
      "Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself, including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries;;\n",
      "One might, indeed, argue that the history of ideas, in so far as it includes the literatures, must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning.\n",
      "We need not, to be sure, expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature.\n",
      "An idea, of the sort that we have in mind, although of necessity readily available to imagination, is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images, especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience.\n",
      "Understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies.\n",
      "Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period.\n",
      "Again, he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways.\n",
      "Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to'' some way of thought labelled as a `` school'' or an `` -ism'', i.e. a complex or `` syndrome'' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification.\n",
      "Usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question, so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` -ism'' or mode of thought.\n",
      "Accordingly we may speak of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley's `` Invictus'', and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise.\n",
      "After all, Shelley is no `` orthodox'' or Hellenic Platonist, and even his `` romantic'' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries.\n",
      "Again, Henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus Aurelius, whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian, comparable to the patience expressed in Milton's sonnet on his own blindness.\n",
      "In recent years, we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts, although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy, of religion, and of the sciences.\n",
      "When these fields are surveyed together, important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence, a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions, primarily literary, religious, and philosophical, but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even, to some extent, with science.\n",
      "Here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian's research.\n",
      "regarded from the inside, it is the carrying into action of a certain thought The historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them.\n",
      "It is a characteristic of thoughts that in re-thinking them we come, ipso facto, to understand why they were thought''.\n",
      "Such an understanding, although it must seek to be sympathetic, is not a matter of intuition.\n",
      "`` History has this in common with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge, except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place, and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration, the grounds upon which it is based.\n",
      "It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns, by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research.\n",
      "The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition, which are at the same time patterns of transformation, whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another.\n",
      "Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades.\n",
      "Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread.\n",
      "No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them.\n",
      "Still, we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology, philosophy, political thought, and literature.\n",
      "Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New Testament.\n",
      "Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible.\n",
      "This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence.\n",
      "A contrast of the scripture reading of, let us say, St. Augustine, John Bunyan, and Thomas Jefferson, all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment, can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression.\n",
      "In much the same way, we recognize the importance of Shakespeare's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne, of Shelley's study of Plato's dialogues, and of Coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William Godwin, through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men of letters.\n",
      "English philosopher Samuel Alexander's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example, as also A. N. Whitehead's understanding of the English romantics, chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth.\n",
      "Again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating, if to our minds grotesque, anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius, who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles.\n",
      "We must avoid the notion, suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned, that ideas are `` units'' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even, for that matter, from one individual to another.\n",
      "`` You could come down to the office once a day, look over a few exchanges, dictate an editorial, and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors.\n",
      "The blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York, and the deal fell through.\n",
      "Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner.\n",
      "Hearst disclaimed blame for this, but the conversation, according to Lane, ended on a tart note.\n",
      "`` Mr. Lane'', Hearst said, `` if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking, and it will be done''.\n",
      "`` Mr. Hearst'', Lane replied as he left, `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery''.\n",
      "Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New York to become a father.\n",
      "Hearst saw his wife and child, sent a joyful message to his mother in California, and soon returned to Washington, where on April 22, for the first time, he opened his mouth in Congress.\n",
      "This was not before the House but before the Judiciary Committee, where he asked for action on one of his pet bills, that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly.\n",
      "Six of the railroads carrying coal to Tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields, Hearst said, not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines.\n",
      "`` The Attorney General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months'', Hearst said.\n",
      "What I want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it, as I am very sure he won't, as he has refused to do anything of the kind, I then wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence.\n",
      "This was the very sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself had in mind.\n",
      "There can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington, overt or implied, to block anything Hearst wanted, even if it was something good.\n",
      "He was a political maverick, a reformer with his own program, determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him.\n",
      "He sought to run Congress as he ran his New York American or Journal, a scheme veteran legislators resisted.\n",
      "For a freshman Congressman to read political Lessons to graybeard Democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends.\n",
      "He soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the House, and came to be regarded with detestation by regular Democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline.\n",
      "Yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant T. R. a semblance of a race.\n",
      "The sneers at Hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country.\n",
      "Platoons of Hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention, and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading.\n",
      "He ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction'', `` rape'', `` abortion'', `` criminal assault'' and `` born out of wedlock''.\n",
      "`` The argument that is cutting most ice is that Hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected.\n",
      "The Hearst men say that if Hearst is nominated, he and his immediate friends will contribute to the Democratic National Committee the sum of $1,500,000.\n",
      "This, it is urged, would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates.\n",
      "The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds, and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless.\n",
      "It has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money, and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of Mr. Hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the Hearst bandwagon''.\n",
      "If anything, the conservative Democrats were more opposed to Hearst than the Republicans.\n",
      "It caused Henry Watterson to sound a blast in his Louisville Courier-Journal:\n",
      "`` Does any sane Democrat believe that Mr. Hearst, a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues, without a word or act in the public life of his country, past or present, that can be shown to be his to commend him, could by any possibility be elected President of the United States??\n",
      "`` It would be a disgrace, and, as I have already said to the people of Tennessee, if Hearst is nominated, we may as well pen a dispatch, and send it back from the field of battle:' All is lost, including our honor'''.\n",
      "A lone pro-Hearst voice from New York City was that of William Devery, who had been expelled as a Tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district.\n",
      "If he's going to the St. Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it.\n",
      "He's got a lot of friends, and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help''.\n",
      "Hearst won the Iowa state convention, but ran into a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker, drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W. Kern:\n",
      "`` We are menaced for the first time in the history of the Republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the Presidential nomination.\n",
      "As for the paid Hessians from other states, we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their duty, I have nothing but contempt.\n",
      "In his fight for the Illinois and Indiana delegations, Hearst made several trips to Chicago to confer with Andrew Lawrence, the former San Francisco Examiner man who was now his Chicago kingpin, and once to meet with Bryan.\n",
      "`` I must hurry to catch my train''.\n",
      "Another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him, saying, `` But Mr. Hearst, what shall I do with this correspondence''??\n",
      "Hearst hopped into a private railroad car with Max Ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states, always wearing a frock coat, listening intently to local politicians, and generally making a good impression.\n",
      "He laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated.\n",
      "`` I should, of course'', he said, `` like any other man, be honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate me.\n",
      "But I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat.\n",
      "I intend to support the nominee of the party at St. Louis, whoever he may be''.\n",
      "When Nan Patterson, a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a Floradora road show, rode down Broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover, Frank Young, she stopped the cab to disclose that Young had been shot dead, tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so.\n",
      "The three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of Trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority.\n",
      "The confused rambling of guerrilla warfare, such as most of Garibaldi's campaigns were, was brought to life by Trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books.\n",
      "His personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result, but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities.\n",
      "The outstanding example was in Garibaldi And The Thousand, where he made use of unpublished papers of Lord John Russell and English consular materials to reveal the motives which led the British government to permit Garibaldi to cross the Straits of Messina.\n",
      "In looking back over the volumes, it is possible to find errors of interpretation, some of which were not so evident at the time of writing.\n",
      "Thus Trevelyan repeats the story which pictured Victor Emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous Statuto at the insistence of General Radetzky.\n",
      "Later research has shown this part of the legend of the Re Galantuomo to be false.\n",
      "Already Trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century Italian studies with several works on English figures of the same period.\n",
      "Yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man, his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength.\n",
      "In the story of Bright and the Corn Law agitation, the Crimean War, the American Civil War, and the franchise struggle Trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long.\n",
      "Because Bright's speeches were so much a part of him, there are long and numerous quotations, which, far from making the biography diffuse, help to give us the feel of the man.\n",
      "Nineteenth-century virtues, however, seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the Bright book has never been particularly popular.\n",
      "It is a Whig history of the `` Tory reaction'' which preceded the Reform Bill of 1832, and it uses the figure of Grey to give some unity to the narrative.\n",
      "The volume is a piece of passionate special pleading, written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom, it must be said -- of a Liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832.\n",
      "The theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was, he has told us, congenial to his artistic sense.\n",
      "And Grey's Northumberland background was close to Trevelyan's own.\n",
      "But his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation.\n",
      "Some historians have found his point of view not to their taste, others have complained that he makes the Tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather than intelligible'', while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which, at times, politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents''.\n",
      "The Liberal-Radical heritage which informs all of Trevelyan's interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period.\n",
      "Research in the period of Grey and Bright led naturally to a more ambitious work.\n",
      "Britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth, to show how economic led to social, and social to political change, how the political events reacted on the economic and social, and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process''.\n",
      "The plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832.\n",
      "More temperately than in the study of Grey and despite his Liberal bias, Trevelyan vividly sketches the England of pre-French Revolution days, portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors, and brings developments leading to the Reform Bill into sharp and clear focus.\n",
      "But after 1832, the narrative tends to lose its balanced, many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics, often unconnected by any single thread.\n",
      "Finally, the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial.\n",
      "Yet Britain In The Nineteenth Century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history, went through edition after edition, and continues to be reprinted up to the very present.\n",
      "Its success is a tribute, above all, to Trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist.\n",
      "In 1924 Trevelyan traveled to the United States, where he delivered the Lowell lectures at Harvard University.\n",
      "Like Green, Trevelyan aimed to write a history not of `` English kings or English conquests'', but of the English people.\n",
      "The History takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than English schoolboys, and like Britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870.\n",
      "His nationalism was not a new characteristic, but its self-consciousness, even its self-satisfaction, is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of English history.\n",
      "Tolerance and compromise, social justice and civil liberty, are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of Trevelyan's emphasis on their central place in the English tradition.\n",
      "Like his volume on Wycliffe, the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents, in this case illustrative of the history of Queen Anne's reign down to 1707.\n",
      "Trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where Macaulay's History Of England had broken off.\n",
      "To most observers, there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of Anne's reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history.\n",
      "His delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life.\n",
      "He tends to underestimate -- or perhaps to view charitably -- the brutality and the violence of the age, so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality.\n",
      "The account of the battle is, next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's campaigns, Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative.\n",
      "If only for this modest masterpiece of military history, Blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the Marlborough wars.\n",
      "Questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities.\n",
      "After making a short statement about human rights, and the freedom to travel, I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany.\n",
      "`` Well, I might not get that far'', I told them, `` as actually I have no papers to enter Germany and, as a matter of fact, no permit to return to France once I leave''.\n",
      "In fact, all persons were permitted to cross the Rhine into Kehl, there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river.\n",
      "That evening, as I learned later, the students, enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students, surged out onto the streets of Strasbourg, overturning empty streetcars, marking up store fronts, and shouting imprudently, `` Garry Davis to power''!!\n",
      "`` Listen please'', I called to the students in French.\n",
      "I ask you all to support me in this.\n",
      "Your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what I am saying.\n",
      "I marched up to the waiting officials, the students massed behind me.\n",
      "The waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade, and asked me in French if I had papers to leave France.\n",
      "I replied in the affirmative, taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite et de voyage, on which was stamped a permission to leave France.\n",
      "One of the uniformed officers stepped in my way, demanding to know whether I had permission to enter Germany.\n",
      "`` No, I have no permission to enter Germany'', I told him.\n",
      "At this, the students let out a yell, knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of Kehl.\n",
      "`` But I have no permission to re-enter France, and I have just left'', I told him.\n",
      "But there is no line between France and Germany, that is, no actual line.\n",
      "You have just given me permission to leave France, which I did.\n",
      "And as you know, I have no permission to re-enter France once out.\n",
      "The students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic, and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile.\n",
      "`` Mais non'', the Interior Ministry man coaxed, `` you may come back to Strasbourg, now, if you wish''.\n",
      "Then will you give me a visa to re-enter France''??\n",
      "`` Ah, then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here'' -- I indicated the French occupation officer -- `` informs me that Germany is just on the other side of him''.\n",
      "Seeing their hesitation, I said, `` Well, until I have permission to enter Germany, or a visa to re-enter France, I shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries'', whereupon I moved to the side of the road, parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk, sat down, took out my typewriter, and began typing the above conversation.\n",
      "The reporters were questioning the Interior man and the French officer, both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action, if any, would be taken in my regard.\n",
      "Finally they went off to file their stories, after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil.\n",
      "`` I don't know'', I told him, `` except that I will be here''.\n",
      "A special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure I didn't cross, the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men, women, and children, dogs, cats, horses, cars, trucks, baby carriages -- could cross Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance.\n",
      "The day passed eventfully enough, with a constant stream of visitors, some stopping only to say hello, others getting into serious conversations, such as one Andre Fuchs, a free-lance journalist from Strasbourg who wrote an article for the Nouvelle Alsatian in highly sympathetic terms.\n",
      "Some students from the University returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week.\n",
      "When I informed her that I didn't, she said she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening.\n",
      "I was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances.\n",
      "Sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side, I pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line'', digging a small trench around it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child.\n",
      "After scouring around a bit in the open area, I came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly, giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky.\n",
      "I had advised friends to write me to `` No Man's Land, Pont Kehl, Between Strasbourg and Kehl, France-Germany''.\n",
      "Sure enough, mail began trickling in, delivered by a talkative, highly amused French postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized.\n",
      "As the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural playground for the kids of the neighborhood, I had made many friends among them, taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately to translate Grimm's Fairy Tales into an understandable French as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent.\n",
      "It was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for me that year.\n",

      "No matter how large the fire, I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day.\n",
      "A voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after I had fallen into a fitful sleep.\n",
      "Later I learned that Sir Hugh Dalton had expressed a desire to see me, hence their trip to `` No Man's Land''.\n",
      "She entreated me to see a doctor, and when I refused, brought one out to see me.\n",
      "Esther, mistaking my hesitation, assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached.\n",
      "`` No, it's not that'', I told her.\n",
      "At that moment, up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from Basel, Switzerland.\n",
      "Without preliminaries, Esther asked him, `` If you are a world citizen, will you take Garry Davis' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital''??\n",
      "I looked from her to him.\n",
      "Esther jumped up, ran to him and gave him a little hug.\n",
      "Such were the incongruities of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted into driving me to the Strasbourg Hospital while World Citizen Jean Babel waved adieu from the `` Line''!!\n",
      "He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final, desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy.\n",
      "Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day.\n",

      "The Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes, among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment.\n",
      "A popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the Civil War that Thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up Stanley for this assault.\n",
      "Sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing Thomas ride so fast.\n",
      "While Thomas' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to.\n",
      "It is not in the record, but he must have galloped his horse at Peach Tree Creek when he brought up Ward's guns to save Newton's crumbling line.\n",
      "While the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at Jonesborough, Thomas, on Sherman's instructions, ordered Slocum, now commanding the Twentieth Corps, to make an effort to occupy Atlanta if he could do so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack.\n",
      "That night a note written in Slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to Sherman stating that the Twentieth Corps was in possession of Atlanta.\n",
      "Before making the news public Sherman sent an officer with the note to Thomas.\n",
      "The cautious Thomas re-examined the note and then, making up his mind that it was genuine, snapped his fingers, whistled and almost danced in his exuberance.\n",
      "The next day Sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to Atlanta.\n",
      "Hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors.\n",
      "By both standards Thomas had the right to be proud.\n",
      "Sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory.\n",
      "Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected.\n",
      "In the midst of this gloom, at 10:05 P.M. on September 2, Slocum's telegram to Stanton, `` General Sherman has taken Atlanta'', shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted Lincoln into the White House.\n",
      "He felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war.\n",
      "Next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action.\n",
      "Sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from Lovejoy's to Atlanta.\n",
      "Within the narrow frame of military tactics, too, the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant.\n",
      "Modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes, camouflage, booby traps, land mines, extended order, trench raids, foxholes, armored cars, night attacks, flares, sharpshooters in trees, interlaced vines and treetops, which were the forerunners of barbed wire, trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge, which presaged the mine trap, and the general use of anesthetics.\n",
      "The use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain''.\n",
      "Orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement.\n",
      "Sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the Atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks.\n",
      "He never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it.\n",
      "He would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country.\n",
      "It failed to work.\n",
      "Every recorded request by Thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses.\n",
      "Well led, properly organized cavalry, in its complementary role to infantry, had four functions.\n",
      "Its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the Atlanta campaign.\n",
      "Thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet, but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it.\n",
      "Sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as Thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings.\n",
      "His conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean, deft, well organized retreats with small materiel losses.\n",
      "Sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways, yet Garrard's Covington raid and Rousseau's Opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and Sherman lived in mortal fear of what Forrest might do to his communications.\n",
      "A proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of Polk's Army of the Mississippi moving up from the direction of Mobile to join Johnston at Dalton.\n",
      "From the night of August 30 to the morning of September 2 there was no Union cavalry east of the Macon railway to disclose to Sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career.\n",
      "It was the hard way to fight a war but Thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes.\n",
      "Heat during the Atlanta campaign, coupled with unsuitable clothing, caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing.\n",
      "Johnston believed that Sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords.\n",
      "In one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of Meynell, Thompson told Patmore of his distress at having had to leave London before this new friendship had developed further: ``\n",
      "He never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning I was to leave for Lymington.\n",
      "The result was that I found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week, only two days before my departure from London.\n",
      "It need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements, which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant.\n",
      "Some, she knew, looked upon Thompson almost as a saint, but others read in `` The Hound Of Heaven'' what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner, who, like Oscar Wilde, had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the swelling wave of every passion''.\n",
      "Consequently, on October 31, 1896, Mrs. King wrote to Thompson, quite against her daughter's wishes, asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which I believe has been dropped for some weeks''.\n",
      "Katherine was staying at a convent, and her mother felt that, as Thompson himself seems to have suggested, she might eventually stay there.\n",
      "This prospect did not please Mrs. King any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a Bohemian, but she used it to suggest to Thompson that, `` It is not in her nature to love you''.\n",
      "For his part, Thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between Katie and himself.\n",
      "At no time does he seem to have proposed marriage, and Mrs. King was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation.\n",
      "In any case, she told Thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see Katie again, `` now that this frank explanation has been made& no one can misunderstand''.\n",
      "She ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor, from which she could not part `` without still more pain''.\n",
      "After Thompson came to London to live, he received a letter from Katie, which was dated February 8, 1897.\n",
      "She regretted what she described as the `` unwarrantable& unnecessary'' check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly.\n",
      "But if you are able& care to come, you know how glad I shall be.\n"

      "It is difficult to say what Thompson expected would come of their relationship, which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by Maggie Brien, but when Katie wrote on April 11, 1900, to tell him that she was to be married to the Rev. Godfrey Burr, the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire, the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse.\n",
      "In a letter to Meynell, which was written in June, less than a month before Katie's wedding, he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets: ``\n",
      "A week in arrears, and without means to pay, I must go, it is the only right thing.\n",
      "Perhaps Mrs. Meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book, with all its mementos of her and the dear ones.\n",
      "Last, not least, there are some poems which K. King sent me( addressed to herself) when I was preparing a fresh volume, asking me to include them.\n",
      "The terrible blow of the New Year put an end to that project.\n",
      "I wish you would return them to her.\n",
      "I never had the courage to look at them, when my projected volume became hopeless, fearing they were poor, until now when I was obliged to do so.\n",
      "What has it all come to??\n",
      "I want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems, dear father-brother, now I am gone;;\n",
      "since my silence must have ended when I gave the purposed volume to you.\n",
      "I ask you to do me the last favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening, about which time I shall come to say my sad good-bye.\n",
      "but this -- yes, terrible step I am about to take is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found hope that here, in these poems, is treasure -- or at least some measure of beauty, which I did not know of''.\n",
      "Thompson, of course, was persuaded not to take the `` terrible step'';;\n",
      "The `` orphaned poems'' mentioned in the letter to Meynell comprised a group of five sonnets, which were published in the 1913 edition of Thompson's works under the heading `` Ad Amicam'', plus certain other completed pieces and rough drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books.\n",
      "The publication of Father Connolly's The Man Has Wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty.\n",
      "The somewhat Petrarchan love story which these poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of autobiographical sincerity.\n",
      "When they were first written, there was evidently no thought of their being published, and those which refer to the writer's love for Mrs. Meynell particularly have the ring of truth.\n",
      "In `` My Song's Young Virgin Date'', for example, Thompson wrote: `` Yea, she that had my song's young virgin date Not now, alas, that noble singular she, I nobler hold, though marred from her once state, Than others in their best integrity.\n",
      "My own stern hand has rent the ancient bond, And thereof shall the ending not have end: But not for me, that loved her, to be fond Lightly to please me with a newer friend Then hold it more than bravest-feathered song, That I affirm to thee, with heart of pride, I knew not what did to a friend belong Till I stood up, true friend, by thy true side;;\n",
      "Taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy loves, there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for Katie King.\n",
      "That she was affected by his protestations seems obvious, but since she was evidently a sensible young woman -- as well as an outgoing and sympathetic type -- it would seem that for her the word friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that which Thompson gave it.\n",
      "From the outset, she must have realized that marriage with him was out of the question, and although she was displeased by the `` unwarrantable'' interference, it seems probable that she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was `` perhaps'' a man `` most fitted to live& die solitary,& in the love only of the Highest Lover''.\n",
      "The poems which were addressed to her, while they are far more restrained than those of `` Love In Dian's Lap'', show no great technical advance over those of the `` Narrow Vessel'' group and are, if anything, somewhat more labored.\n",
      "Whether or not Danchin is correct in suggesting that Thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from this period is, of course, a matter of conjecture.\n",
      "Reid simply states, without offering any supporting evidence, that `` after he returned to London, he resumed his draughts of laudanum, and continued this right up to his death''.\n",
      "There is every reason to recognize that in the very last years of his life, as we shall see, Thompson did take the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness, but the exact date at which this began has never been determined.\n",
      "If, as Reid says, `` nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium'', there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse.\n",
      "In any event, the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that if he was taking laudanum, it was never in command of him to the extent that it had been during his vagrant years.\n",
      "He simply found more work for him to do, and the articles and reviews continued without an evident break.\n",
      "That he read some of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from his notes, which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without his signature.\n",
      "On the basis of this careful reading, Thompson frequently gave a clear, complete, and interesting description of a prose work or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry.\n",
      "He was seldom an unmethodical critic, and his reviews generally followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work contained, a treatment of the things that had especially interested him in it, and, wherever possible, a balancing of whatever artistic merits and faults he might have found.\n",
      "It was, of course, in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author.\n",
      "Reviewing Davidson's The Testament Of An Empire Builder, for example, Thompson found that there was `` too much metrical dialectic''.\n",
      "Poetry, he said, must be `` dogmatic'': it must not stoop to argue like a `` K.C. in cloth-of-gold''.\n",
      "Yet Davidson impressed him as a poet capable of `` sustained power, passion, or beauty'', and he cited specific passages to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's command of imagery as well.\n",
      "Similarly, he wrote that Laurence Housman had a `` too deliberate manner'' as well as a lack of `` inevitable felicity in diction''.\n",
      "Understanding, as he did, the difficulty of the art of poetry, and believing that the `` only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of poets'', he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please when it came to the review of a book of verse.\n",
      "As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before, Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec.\n",
      "By June 19, 1788, he had presented himself to its Commander in Chief, the Governor of the Southern Provinces, the Director of the War College -- The Prince.\n",
      "Catherine's first war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her.\n",
      "By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now, in this second combat with the Crescent, were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea's northern shoreline.\n",
      "those of 1788 were going to prove decisive, though many of their details are obscure.\n",
      "To consolidate what her Navy had won, the Czarina was fortunate that, for the first time in Russian history, her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite Giaour.\n",
      "Here the war would flame to its focus, and here Lewis Littlepage had come.\n",
      "Potemkin's Army of Ekaterinoslav, totaling, it was claimed, 40,000 regular troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps, had invested Islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea, the fortress town of Oczakov, and was preparing to test the Turk by land and sea.\n",
      "As his second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin, one-time Ambassador to Poland.\n",
      "Some people thought he lacked both ability and character, but most agreed that he was noble in appearance and, for a Russian, humane.\n",
      "The Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well.\n",
      "At General Headquarters the newcomer in turn got to know others.\n",
      "There was the Neapolitan, Ribas, a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith but who had fawned his way up the ladder of Catherine's and Potemkin's favor till he was now a brigadier( and would one day be the daggerman designated to do in Czar Paul 1,, after traveling all the way to Naples to procure just the right stiletto).\n",
      "and General the Count Pallavicini, founder of the Austrian branch of that celebrated Italian house, a courtier Littlepage could have met at Madrid in December, 1780.\n",
      "Though Catherine was vexed at the number of French officers streaming to the Turkish standard, there were several under her own, such as the Prince De Nassau;;\n",
      "the energetic Parisian, Roger De Damas, three year's Littlepage's junior, to whom Nassau had taken a liking;;\n",
      "and the artillerist, Colonel Prevost, whom the Count De Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills to Nassau.\n",
      "England contributed a young subaltern named Newton and the naval architect Samuel Bentham, brother to the economist, who for his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet.\n",
      "Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's and Nassau's naval command post.\n",
      "On arrival at headquarters he had, however -- in King Stanislas' words to Glayre -- `` found such favor with Pe Potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want him to go join Paul Jones.\n",
      "Having done so, he began to experience all the frustrations of others who attempted to get along with Serenissimus and do a job at the same time.\n",
      "At headquarters -- sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally that you were in a war -- Lewis found that the Commander in Chief's only desk was his knees( and his only comb, his fingers).\n",
      "Lewis could let his eye caress The Prince's divan, covered with a rose-pink and silver Turkish cloth, or admire the lovely tapis, interwoven with gold, that spread across the floor.\n",
      "For if Serenissimus made the sign of the Cross with his right hand, and meant it, with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his eye.\n",
      "Right now he found Sophie De Witt, that magnificent young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec four years ago.\n",
      "One evening he passed around the banquet table a crystal cup full of diamonds, requesting every female guest to select one as a souvenir.\n",
      "When a lady chanced to soil a pair of evening slippers, Brigadier Bauer was dispatched to Paris for replacements.\n",
      "But if The Prince fancied women and was fascinated by foreigners, he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates.\n",
      "His coat trimmed in sable, diamond stars of the Orders of Saints Andrew or George agleam, he was often prone to sit sulkily, eye downcast, in a Scheherazade trance.\n",
      "He stays inactive for half the summer in front of Oczakov, a quite second-rate spot, begins to besiege it formally only during the autumn rains, and finally carries it by assault in the heart of winter.\n",
      "There's a man who never goes by the ordinary road but still arrives at his goal, who gratuitously gets himself into difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat, in a word a man who creates monsters for himself in order to appear a Hercules in destroying them''.\n",
      "His gray hair was thin, his face beginning to attract a swarm of wrinkles.\n",
      "Kind by nature, he never refused charity to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it( as Lewis would one day discover).\n",
      "But he was perpetually engaged in a battle to command his own temper.\n",
      "better to give an asinine answer than none at all.\n",
      "He rose at 4:00 A.M. the year round and was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake his men.\n",
      "his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon;;\n",
      "He hadn't worn a watch or carried pocket money for years because he disliked both, but highest among his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's grasp and smashed it to smithereens.\n",
      "He kept several pet birds and liked cats well enough that if one crept by, he would mew at it in friendly fashion.\n",
      "Yet General Suvorov -- who had never forgotten hearing his adored Czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities -- was mad only north, northwest.\n",
      "He had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at Court;;\n",
      "He had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature.\n",
      "He dabbled in verse, could get along well among most of the European languages, and was fluent in French and German.\n",
      "He knew how to channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere plunderers into A-1 guerrilla fighters.\n",
      "broad red stripes down the trouser leg;;\n",
      "broader leather belt round the waist, holding cartridges and light sabre.\n",
      "Suvorov played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops.\n",
      "It was probably at this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary Russian soldier.\n",
      "They emerged as interchangeable cogs in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked, hair queued, greatcoated, jackbooted, and best of all -- in the opinion of the British professional, Major Semple-Lisle -- `` their minds are not estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny''.\n",
      "Mando, pleading her cause, must have said that Dr. Brown was the most distinguished physician in the United States of America, for our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating the irregularity of his pulse.\n",
      "`` He's got high blood pressure, too, and bum kidneys'', the doctor said to me.\n",
      "`` Transparent look, waxy skin -- could well be uremia''.\n",
      "Seeing this, his colleague at the next desk gave a short, contemptuous laugh, pushed forward his own ash tray, innocent of a single butt, thumped his chest to show his excellent condition, and looked proud.\n",
      "At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers.\n",
      "We went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials awaited us, the rest of the office personnel hot upon our heels.\n",
      "By this time word had got around that an American doctor was on the premises.\n",
      "One fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great healer.\n",
      "`` You know'', Norton said to me later, `` I am thinking of setting up the Klinico Brownapopolus.\n",
      "After luncheon we took advantage of the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend Deppy had written.\n",
      "Several years of her life have been spent in the homeland, and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming.\n",
      "`` All you have to do, Ilka dear, is to phone on your arrival.\n",
      "They are longing to see you''.\n",
      "The wear and tear of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers, but I planned on being the soul of tact, of giving them plenty of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already running over without us.\n",
      "Greek phone service is worse than French, so that it was to be some little time before contact of any sort was established.\n",
      "In the late afternoon Mando came back to fetch us, and we drove to the Acropolis.\n",
      "We stopped first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned by the Parthenon.\n",
      "The carved statues of the frieze against the low wall are for the most part headless, but their exquisitely graceful nude and draped torsos and the kneeling Atlantes are well preserved in their perfect proportion.\n",
      "I suppose the same emotion holds, if to a lesser degree, with any famous monument.\n",
      "Will it live up to its reputation??\n",
      "The weight of fame and history is formidable, and dreary steel engravings in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination.\n",
      "And then perhaps one day we get to Athens.\n",
      "The light at that time is a benediction.\n",
      "All we wanted to do was to stand very quietly and look and look and look.\n",
      "More than twenty-four hundred years old, bruised, battered, worn and partially destroyed, combining to an astounding degree solidity and grace, it still stands, incomparable testimony to man's aspiration.\n",
      "It was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding Venetian army and the great central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens.\n",
      "The architectural feature, the caryatides upholding the portico, famous around the world as the Porch of the Maidens, was referred to airily by Mando as the Girls' Place.\n",
      "My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge -- besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors of the baptistery in Florence -- is the three styles of Greek columns.\n",
      "It remained, however, for Mando to teach me that Doric symbolized strength, Ionic wisdom, and Corinthian beauty, the three pillars of the ancient world.\n",
      "Another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the Evzone sentry, in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes, who was patrolling up and down in front of the palace.\n",
      "Gun on shoulder, he would march smartly for a few yards, bring his heels together with a click, make a brisk pirouette, skirts flaring, and march back to his point of departure.\n",
      "We did not dare speak to so exalted a being, but Norton aimed his camera and shot him, so to speak, on the rise, the split second between the halt and the turn.\n",
      "The evening of our first day we drove with Christopher and Judy Sakellariadis, who were friends and patients of Norton, to dine at a restaurant on the shores of the Aegean.\n",
      "The great spectacle was a source of rancor, and Son et Lumiere, which the French were trying to promote with the Athenians, was the reason.\n",
      "By a combination of music, lighting effects, and narration, famous events that have transpired in these locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to considerable acclaim.\n",
      "The Acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment too, but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full moon when the Athenians themselves, out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion, were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination.\n",
      "The Artists contended that the Philistines, gross of soul, were all for having Son et Lumiere, since the French were footing the bill and the attraction, wherever it had been done, had proven popular.\n",
      "The Acropolis was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight wasn't enough for both natives and tourists, then they were quite simply barbarians and the hell with them.\n",
      "The restaurant to which the Sakellariadises took us on this night of controversy was the Asteria, on Asteria beach.\n",

      "Although open to the general public it is not overcrowded;;\n",
      "the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home.\n",
      "We went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.\n",
      "The other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols, though modest from an American point of view, still is a little high for many Athenians.\n",
      "We were struck by the notable absence of banana skins and beer cans, but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on Greek refinement, perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable radios.\n",

      "In proportion to the degradation of his moral worth, is the increase of his worth to them''.\n",
      "To exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation, Pike took another course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked.\n",
      "He claimed in his attacks that Woodruff, with scurrilous underhandedness, had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing.\n",
      "The charge was so farfetched that Woodruff paid little attention to it, and answered Pike in a rather bored way, wearily declaring that a `` new hand'' was pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ, and concluding: `` In a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles, even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels.\n",
      "We therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd to which he belongs''.\n",
      "Despite Woodruff's continuing refusal to debate with Pike through the columns of his newspaper, Pike did not let up his attack for a moment.\n",
      "So persistent were these attacks that in March of the following year, Woodruff was finally moved to action, and Pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics, the subtle art of diversion.\n",
      "To attack Pike directly would gain Woodruff little, for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing to lose.\n",
      "By this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike as a man of great personal pride, a man who would fly into a towering rage if his integrity were questioned, and who would be anxious to avenge himself.\n",
      "The charges would be made in The Gazette by an anonymous correspondent, and Pike would be so busy trying to track down the illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing Woodruff.\n",
      "The anonymous correspondent did not resort to innuendoes.\n",
      "Outraged, he used the Advocate of March 7th for a denial, sending immediately to Santa Fe and Van Buren for documents to vindicate himself, and demanding that Woodruff reveal the name of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym.\n",
      "Woodruff said nothing, and Pike, frustrated, stormed throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for `` Vale'', asking his friends to keep their ears open.\n",
      "Finally he learned through the grapevine that the culprit might be one James W. Robinson in Pope County.\n",
      "Without further inquiry, Pike jumped to the conclusion that Robinson was guilty, and, following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground, sent a message to Robinson through his friends, demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity.\n",
      "To Pike, silence was tantamount to an admission of guilt, and he determined to get Robinson onto the dueling ground at all costs.\n",
      "On April 11th he wrote an open letter in The Advocate, making it known `` to the world that Jas. W. Robinson is by his own admission a base liar and a slanderer''.\n",
      "If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer, he was also a very canny gentleman, for nothing that Pike could do would pry so much as a single word out of him.\n",
      "Preoccupied with his own defense and his attempts to get Robinson to fight, Pike lessened his attacks on Woodruff, and finally stopped them altogether.\n",
      "It took Pike a long time to realize what Woodruff had done, and it had a profound effect on him.\n",
      "In the next few months of comparative silence, Pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack, and then, displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting, gained from his first bout with Woodruff, he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage.\n",
      "Shortly after the `` Vale'' incident, a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope.\n",
      "One-armed, gruff, frugally honest, Governor Pope had been the ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after the disgraceful antics of political bosses like Crittenden, and he ruled the state with an iron fist, tolerating no nonsense.\n",
      "This warm relationship came to an abrupt end in June of 1834 when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 for compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory, and, taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature, left it to the governor to award the contract.\n",
      "Woodruff wanted this political windfall very badly, and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter.\n",
      "But because the governor was determined that friendship should not influence him one way or the other, he looked for a printer with a knowledge of the law( which Woodruff did not have), and awarded the contract to a lawyer named John Steele who had started a newspaper in Helena the year before.\n",
      "`` We think the governor treated us rather shabbily, to say the least of it.\n",
      "It is but justice to Mr. Steele for us to add that, in the above remarks, nothing is intended to his disparagement, either as a lawyer or as a printer.\n",
      "We hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle him to credit''.\n",
      "As summer cooled into fall and winter, even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder by the day, and by December of 1834 it was icy.\n",
      "It was at this point that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two men.\n",
      "The eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that Woodruff still held.\n",
      "From his first bout with the canny Woodruff, Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly, so, harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too high, he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs to exist.\n",
      "Then he called on the governor to explain why.\n",
      "The governor was not used to having his integrity questioned, and he promptly passed the charges on to Woodruff, demanding that Woodruff answer them.\n",
      "If Woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation, the governor insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in The Advocate.\n",
      "As a proud man, his prestige would suffer if he let Pike dictate to him through the governor's office, but to lower his prices would be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first place.\n",
      "Very angry at Woodruff, the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract withdrawn from The Gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder, which, by a strange coincidence, happened to be Pike's Advocate.\n",
      "But in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics, alliances were as quickly broken as they were formed, and as Pike came to favor with the governor of the Territory, the governor fell out of favor with the President of the United States.\n",
      "On January 28, 1835, Andrew Jackson removed Pope from office and elevated Territorial Secretary William S. Fulton to the position.\n",
      "as Pike proved himself adept in the political arena, he also became a social lion in the village of Little Rock, where he served as a symbol of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly to cultivate.\n",
      "After all, Pike was an established poet and his work had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of American culture, Boston.\n",
      "His accomplishments, and the fact that he was resident, did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to describe Little Rock after a visit there.\n",
      "Pike enjoyed his new social position tremendously, and cultivated in himself those traits necessary to its preservation.\n",
      "He again began to play the violin, and tucking the instrument beneath his chin, performed soulful and romantic airs to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him.\n",
      "He composed songs and set them to music and sang them in a soft, melodious voice, and when his audience had had enough of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike.\n",
      "The orator of this period, in order to earn a reputation, had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech, judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it.\n",
      "Very soon after his arrival in Little Rock, Pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town, the Little Rock Debating Society, and it was with this group that he made his debut as an orator, being invited to deliver the annual Fourth of July address the club sponsored every year.\n",
      "There is plenty more to recommend Gorton, the facts of whose life are given in The Life And Times Of Samuel Gorton, by Adelos Gorton.\n",
      "He defied the Boston hierarchy, and after they sent a small army to get him he befuddled the court, including John Cotton, with one of the most complicated religious discourses ever heard.\n",
      "Gorton left England, he said, `` to enjoy libertie of conscience in respect to faith towards God, and for no other end''.\n",
      "Gorton and his family moved to Plymouth.\n",
      "It had been whispered privately that she had smiled in the congregation, and the Governor Prence sent to knoe her business, and command, after punishment as the bench see fit, her departure and also anyone who brought her to the place from which she came'''.\n",
      "Gorton said they were preparing to deport her as a vagabond, and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for several days, returning at night.\n",
      "He advised the poor woman not to appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of law.\n",
      "Gorton appeared for her, however, and what he told the magistrates must have been plenty, for he was charged with deluding the court, fined, and told to leave the colony within fourteen days.\n",
      "One can imagine that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak nerves.\n",
      "William Coddington, who was running the colony, felt constrained to move seven miles south where, with others -- as mentioned above -- he founded Newport.\n",
      "When, in March, 1640, the two towns were united under Coddington, Gorton claimed the union was irregular and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the majority of freeholders.\n",
      "Then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth.\n",
      "The old woman complained to the deputy governor, who ordered the servant brought before the court.\n",
      "Gorton reverted to his Plymouth tactics, refused to let her go, and appeared himself before the Portsmouth grand jury.\n",
      "Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the town in a turmoil.\n",
      "He held that no group of colonists could set up or maintain a government without royal sanction.\n",
      "Since Rhode Island at that time did not have such sanction, his opinion was not popular.\n",
      "yet the tide is too strong against us, and I fear( if the framer of hearts help not) it will force me to little Patience, a little isle next to your Prudence''.\n",
      "Providence finally managed to get Gorton out of the town, and he and some friends bought land at Pawtuxet on the west side of Narragansett Bay, five miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the Providence colony.\n",
      "Up to now, Gorton had been looking for trouble, and now that he was trying to get away from it, trouble started looking for him.\n",
      "Upon intelligence that the formidable agitator was to favor them with his presence, the benighted inhabitants of Pawtuxet, alas, gave their allegiance to Massachusetts and asked that colony to expel the newcomers.\n",
      "As it was the custom of that alert colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection, this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack of wolves and saying `` Come and get it''.\n",
      "Gorton and company, however, promptly bought land from Miantonomi a few miles south of Pawtuxet, extending from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick Neck and twenty miles inland.\n",
      "Instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam.\n",
      "Pomham and Soconoco, a couple of minor sachems( of something less than exalted character) under Miantonomi, declared that they had never assented to the sale of land to Gorton and had never received anything for it.\n",
      "Following the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet, they also submitted themselves to the protection of Massachusetts.\n",
      "One historical authority presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled Gorton.\n",
      "However, the General Court at Boston ordered the purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems' claim.\n",
      "Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics.\n",
      "It pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters, and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used.\n",
      "The next week, forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants.\n",
      "The latter tried to arbitrate through a delegation from Providence, which offer was declined by the invaders.\n",
      "The Commissioners at Boston wrote the victims to see their misdeeds and repent or they should `` look upon them as men prepared for slaughter''.\n"

      "That was in the days before blood banks, of course, and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to patient.\n",
      "One had to find a donor, and usually very quickly, whose blood corresponded with the patient's.\n",

      "Papa had left us about the same hour of the night that Ben had passed on.\n",
      "A few years before his death Papa had agreed with Mama to make a joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of the death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash.\n",
      "Fred and Ralph qualified as executors and paid off what debts were currently due, and they were all current, since Papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid.\n",
      "After they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs, Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars, as I remember, with which to pay the bequests.\n",
      "This, manifestly, would not provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children.\n",
      "So what Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received, if anything, from the estate before Papa's death.\n",
      "Consequently, Fred and Tom, the two who had been provided college educations, signed statements to the effect that each had received his bequest in full, and Effie and I were each allotted $5000.\n",
      "Frank had been given about half his legacy to use in a business venture before Papa's death;;\n",
      "he was given the difference between that amount and $5000.\n",
      "So, because he had received less than Tom, it was felt proper that Fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained.\n",
      "Had he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism, I'm convinced, Papa would have left a sizable estate.\n",
      "But he had succeeded well, we agreed.\n",

      "But he never expected to do that.\n",
      "But he had delayed accepting this job, and as he was leaving to come home to Papa in response to our telegram, he dropped a postcard to Miss McCrady, head of the Harvard Appointment Office, asking her please to write Northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances.\n",
      "Actually Tom had been postponing giving them an answer, I'm confident, because he did not want to go out there to teach.\n",
      "In fact, he didn't want to teach anywhere.\n",
      "He wanted to go back to Harvard for another year of playwriting.\n",
      "But Papa's death had further complicated the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year, and for the weeks following it Tom did not know whether his return to Harvard could be arranged.\n",
      "But things were worked out in the family and late in August he wrote Miss McCrady an explanatory letter in which he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition after Papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home with Mama, accept the Northwestern job, or return to Harvard.\n",
      "But he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition that he could go back to Harvard for a third year with Professor Baker.\n",
      "I think I'm right in that figure.\n",
      "That fall he submitted to Professor Baker the first acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays, six of them, according to some of his associates, and he also worked on a play that he first called Niggertown, the material for which he had collected during the summer at home.\n",
      "In the spring, it must have been, he began working on the play that he called The House, which later would be Mannerhouse.\n",
      "Tom never knew how to condense, to boil down.\n",
      "He was always concerned with life, and he tried to picture it whole;;\n",
      "In describing it to Professor Baker after it had been chosen for production, he defended his great array of characters by declaring that he had included that many not because `` I didn't know how to save paint'', but because the play required them.\n",
      "And he threatened someday to write a play `` with fifty, eighty, a hundred people -- a whole town, a whole race, a whole epoch''.\n",
      "That summer Tom attended the summer session at Harvard, but he did not ask Mama to send him back in the fall.\n",
      "Instead, he went down to New York and submitted Welcome To Our City to the Theatre Guild, which had asked him to let them have a look at it after Professor Baker had recommended it highly.\n",
      "He hung around New York, waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time came down to Asheville and also paid a short visit to Chapel Hill, where with almost childish delight he visited old friends and favorite campus spots.\n",
      "On returning to New York he had a job for several weeks;;\n",
      "it was visiting University of North Carolina alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to the Graham Memorial Building fund.\n",
      "Well, the Theatre Guild kept that play, and kept it, and finally in December they turned it down.\n",
      "Tom told me about it, how one evening he went over to see the Theatre Guild man.\n",
      "This man, Tom said, had the play shut up in his desk, I believe, and when Tom sat down, he pulled it out and apologetically told Tom that they wouldn't be able to use it.\n",
      "The man, Tom said, explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted.\n",
      "The public, Tom said the man told him, wanted realism, and his play wasn't that.\n",
      "Tom was not willing to revise the play according to the plan the man suggested.\n",
      "Such a revision, he said, would ruin it, would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment.\n",

      "No load of sin had been laid on my shoulders, nor did earnest effort enable me to become conscious of one.\n",
      "There is, of course, the doctrine of original sin, which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes of the guilt of our first ancestor.\n",

      "It is puzzling to the occidental mind( to mine at least) to assign `` sacredness'' to animal, insect, and plant life.\n",
      "There is indeed a moral responsibility on man himself, for his own soul's sake, to respect lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering, but this viewpoint Schweitzer rejects.\n",
      "So far as `` sacredness'' inheres in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality, whether in Lambarene, Africa, or in Washington, D.C..\n",
      "One cannot read the records of scientists, officials and travelers who have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing that each individual met with is a person.\n",
      "Read, for instance, in Malcolm MacDonald's Borneo People of Segura and her wise father Tomonggong Koh, and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization.\n",

      "As to our action, let us align ourselves with the purpose expressed by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer: `` Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven''.\n",
      "With the knowledge that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations with all people, we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means and the ends of our lives.\n",
      "This intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well, because I was never content to lead a divided life.\n",
      "As I have said, words from Tennyson remain ever in my memory: `` That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as before''.\n",
      "Let us now give some thought to the soul.\n",
      "When the young biologist, Dr. Ballard, began to show interest in our daughter Elizabeth, this induced a corresponding interest, on our part, in him.\n",
      "He told me that he had a big newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto the big newt.\n",
      "He was then noting that the big eye on the little newt hung back until the little eye had grown up to it, while the little eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other.\n",
      "Then I asked, `` What does that teach you''??\n",
      "Said he, `` It teaches me to wonder''.\n",
      "In the face of the unfolding universe, our ultimate attitude is that of wonder.\n",
      "Wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world.\n",
      "Gone are the days when, in the nineteenth century, scientists thought that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of the physical universe.\n",
      "For them only a little more needed to be learned, and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted, packaged and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem.\n",
      "This complacency was blown to bits by the relativity of Einstein, the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe.\n",
      "It is as if we, in our center of human observation, from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown.\n",
      "There are some people, intelligent people, who seem to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives.\n",
      "His inability to wonder vitiates his argument.\n",
      "The subject of immortality brings to mind a vivid incident which took place in 1929 at Montreux in Switzerland.\n",
      "Altogether, the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones, for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider art above ethics, all the way from Plato to Poe.\n",
      "All through The Republic, Plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens.\n",
      "When he turns briefly to literary style, in the Third Book, he again looks to the effect on the audience.\n",
      "He explains that his citizens must not be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that one finds in much poetry, and he observes that all `` these pantomimic gentlemen'' will be sent to another state.\n",
      "When he discusses tyrants in the Eighth Book of The Republic, he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst rulers.\n",
      "But the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears in the Tenth Book, and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms.\n",
      "In Plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the poet and the philosopher, because the poet imitates only particular objects and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction, much less the highest level of ideal forms.\n",
      "The same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both Babbitt and More, that we must examine it in some detail.\n",
      "Plato feels that man has two competing aspects, his rational faculty and his irrational.\n",
      "and poetry, with all its emphasis on the passions, encourages the audience to give way to emotion.\n",
      "For this reason, then, poetry tends to weaken the power of control, the reason, because it tempts one to indulge his passions, and even the best of men, he maintains, may be corrupted by this subtle influence.\n",
      "Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an enigma, because he is so completely sensitive to its charm.\n",
      "His whole objection, indeed, seems to rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have great power to influence, but Plato seldom pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself.\n",
      "He is, rather, concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice.\n",
      "He wants them to use their great power to strengthen man's rational side, to teach virtue, and to encourage religion.\n",
      "While Plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns to the gods and famous men, still he clearly leaves the way open for further discussion of the issue.\n",
      "He even calls upon the poets to defend the Muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue.\n",
      "We may further grant to those of her( Poetry's) defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets, the permission to speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit;;\n",
      "for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers -- I mean, if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight''.\n",
      "When we turn to Aristotle's ideas on the moral measure of literature, it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned about the influence of the art.\n",
      "In the ideal state, for instance, he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories.\n",
      "and the young people should not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public tables.\n",
      "By the time they reach that age, however, Aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence of comedies.\n",
      "In Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the Poetics, we find an attempt to isolate the art, to consider only those things proper to it, to discover how it differs from other arts, and to deal with the effects peculiar to it.\n",
      "He assures us, early in the Poetics, that all art is `` imitation'' and that all imitation gives pleasure, but he distinguishes between art in general and poetic art on the basis of the means, manner, and the objects of the imitation.\n",
      "Once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms, he lays down his famous definition of tragedy, which sets up standards and so lends direction to the remainder of the work.\n",
      "A tragedy, by his definition, is an imitation of an action that is serious, of a certain magnitude, and complete in itself.\n",
      "It should have a dramatic form with pleasing language, and it should portray incidents which so arouse pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience.\n",
      "Throughout the rest of the Poetics, Aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their interrelationship, and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.\n",
      "Aristotle's method in the Poetics, then, does suggest that we should isolate the work.\n",
      "The Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation.\n",
      "For one thing, Aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt the audience.\n",
      "In addition, his definition of a tragedy invites our attention, because a serious and important action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author or of the characters.\n",
      "And there is one other point in the Poetics that invites moral evaluation: Aristotle's notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity and fear.\n",
      "He rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to that end.\n",
      "The point is that an ethical critic, with an assist from Freud, can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless outlet for our hostile urges.\n",
      "In his study Samuel Johnson, Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that what Aristotle really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is `` less likely that we shall indulge them through our own acts''.\n",
      "In Krutch's view, this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without employing the explicit methods of a moralist.\n",
      "And we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions.\n",
      "Or in more Freudian terms, the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen the ego and superego.\n",
      "No one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were irrelevant.\n",
      "Both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral test, but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad influence.\n",
      "Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported their cause.\n",
      "Those who wanted to close the theaters, for example, pointed to Plato's Republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the Plato of the Ion to testify in their behalf.\n",
      "The most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps Sir Philip Sidney's An Apologie For Poetrie, published in 1595.\n",
      "Many students of literature know that classical defense.\n",
      "What is not so well known, however, and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel, is the kind of attack on literature that Sidney was answering.\n",
      "For this reason, then I want to describe, first, two examples of the puritanical attacks: Stephen Gosson's The School Of Abuse, 1579, and his later Playes Confuted, published in 1582.\n",
      "Second, we will see how Sidney answered the charges, for while Sidney's essay was not specifically a reply to Gosson, his arguments do support the new theater.\n",
      "According to William Ringler's study, Stephen Gosson, the theater business in London had become a thriving enterprise by 1577, and, in the opinion of many, a thoroughly bad business.\n",
      "Aroused by what they considered an evil influence, some members of the clergy, joined by city authorities, merchants, and master craftsmen, began the attack on the plays and the actors for what they called `` the abuses of the art'', but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of acting.\n",
      "Although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from some men who were not technically Puritans, still, once the Puritans gained power, they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance of 1642 which decreed that all `` public stage-plays shall cease and be forborne''.\n",
      "With that act of Parliament the opponents of the stage won the day, and for more than two decades after that England had no legitimate public drama.\n",
      "In the early days of this controversy over the theater one of the interested parties, Stephen Gosson, published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses of art, rather than the art itself.\n",
      "But his opposition hardened and by 1579, in The School Of Abuse, he was ready to banish all `` players''.\n",
      "He advises women to beware `` of those places which in sorrows cheere you and beguile you in mirth''.\n",
      "He warns that a single glance can lead us into temptation, for `` Looking eies have lyking hartes, and lyking hartes may burne in lust''.\n",
      "But it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached.\n",
      "Fortunately, it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in education.\n",
      "We find, in the first place, that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education, positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing, do not accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the public prints, and, on the whole, approve of the way their university deals with value-problems and value inculcation.\n",
      "It is not our impression that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful ignorance;;\n",
      "rather, the generality of these students find their university experience congenial to their own sense of values.\n",
      "Other conceivable goals, such as character-education and social adjustment, are of secondary importance to them.\n",
      "Even in such technical curricula as engineering, the senior is much more likely than the freshman to choose, as an ideal, liberal education over specific vocational preparation.\n",
      "And, contrary to many popular assertions, the goal-values chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic success nor to mere conformity.\n",
      "Our students want occupations that permit them to use their talents and training, to be creative and original, to work with and to help other people.\n",
      "they set limits to their aspirations -- few aspire to millions of dollars or to `` imperial'' power and glory.\n",
      "Within the fixed frame of these aspirations, they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power, prestige, and wealth.\n",
      "Occupational choices are also useful -- and interesting -- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute the only component in goals and aspirations.\n",
      "For there is also the `` face of reality'' in the form of the individual's perceptions of his own abilities and interests, of the objective possibilities open to him, of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed.\n",
      "Students develop occupational images -- not always accurate or detailed -- and they try to fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation.\n",
      "Furthermore, many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands, or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity, or of ability and performance.\n",
      "Thus, many a creativity-oriented aspirant for a career in architecture, drama, or journalism, resigns himself to a real estate business;;\n",
      "many a people-oriented student who dreams of the M.D. decides to enter his father's advertising agency;;\n",
      "and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it.\n",
      "The old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant -- but so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy.\n",
      "In their views on dating, courtship, sex, and family life, our students prefer what they are expected to prefer.\n",
      "They even accept the `` double standard'' of sex morality in a double sense, i.e., both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards for women, and women apply to both sexes a standard different from that held by men.\n",
      "In the field of political values, it is certainly true that students are not radical, not rebels against their parents or their peers.\n",
      "And as they go through college, the students tend to bring their political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups to which they belong.\n",
      "The students who are most willing to acquiesce in the suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to be prejudiced against minority groups, to be conformist and traditionalistic in general social attitudes, and to lack a basic faith in people.\n",
      "In other words, as students go through college, those who are most successful academically tend to become more committed to a `` Bill of Rights'' orientation.\n",
      "This finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties than the other students.\n",
      "There is now substantial evidence from several major studies of college students that the experience of the college years results in a certain, selective homogenization of attitudes and values.\n",
      "Detached from their prior statuses and social groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu, the students tend to assimilate a new common culture, to converge toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus.\n",
      "Furthermore, in certain respects, there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country.\n",
      "The interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to converge include toleration of diversity.\n",
      "To the extent that our sampling of the orientations of American college students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our culture -- and still valid in 1959 -- we are disposed to question the summary characterization of the current generation as silent, beat, apathetic, or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes.\n",
      "Our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society, and, in the face of the realities of complex and large-scale economic and political problems, make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized responsibility for coping with such collective concerns.\n",
      "It is even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity -- `` everyone does it'' -- as a criterion for conduct.\n",
      "And it may be well to recall that to say `` conformity'' is, in part, another way of saying `` orderly human society''.\n",
      "In the field of religious beliefs and values, the college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture.\n",
      "Students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy.\n",
      "Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity.\n",
      "Our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and religiously involved.\n",
      "Upon second thought we were forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks against which we might compare the present situation, and that conclusions that present-day students are `` more'' or `` less'' religious could not be defended on the basis of our data.\n",
      "As we looked more intently at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation, we received the impression that many of the religious convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance, of low intensity.\n",
      "But, here again, comparative benchmarks are lacking, and we do not know, in any case, what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect from healthy, young, secure and relatively inexperienced persons;;\n",
      "A variety of data are assembled to bear upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality, work-success ethic, individualism, achievement, lessened emphasis on future-time orientation in favor of sociability, moral relativism, consideration and tolerance, conformity, hedonistic present-time orientation.\n",
      "Although he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion and the alleged increase in conformity, and thinks that `` hedonistic'' present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed to it, he does conclude that Americans increasingly enjoy leisure without guilt, do not stress achievement so much as formerly, are more accepting of group harmony as a goal, more tolerant of diversity and aware of other cultures.\n",
      "From New Jersey, Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington at Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, arriving there on November 18th.\n",
      "Even on his tough constitution, the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest.\n",
      "In order to prevent this, Washington hastened to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort, including a force under the Marquis De Lafayette containing some 160 of Morgan's riflemen, all who were fit for duty at this time, the rest having no shoes.\n",
      "Although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of Cornwallis, Morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing at the redcoats.\n",
      "A picket guard of about 350, mostly Hessians, were attacked by the Americans under Lafayette, and driven back to their camp, some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire.\n",
      "`` I never saw men'', Lafayette declared in regard to the riflemen, `` so merry, so spirited, and so desirous to go on to the enemy, whatever force they might have, as that small party in this fight''.\n",
      "Nathanael Greene told Washington that `` Lafayette was charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen''.\n",
      "A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an attack upon the American camp.\n",
      "The British general moved his forces north from Philadelphia to Chestnut Hill, near the right wing of the patriot encampment.\n",
      "Morgan was ordered to attack the enemy, who had meantime moved to Edge Hill on the left of the Americans.\n",
      "Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia.\n",
      "Morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait.\n",
      "A body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope, a tempting target for the riflemen, who threw a volley into their ranks and `` messed up'' the smart formation considerably.\n",
      "Now the riflemen and the Marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the British, giving them another telling round of fire.\n",
      "The British, although suffering considerable losses, noted the defection of the Marylanders, made a stand, then turned and attacked Morgan who became greatly outnumbered and had to retire.\n",
      "The Americans lost forty-four men, among them Major Joseph Morris of Morgan's regiment, an officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection, not only by his commander, but by Washington and Lafayette as well.\n",
      "The latter was so upset on learning of the death of Morris, that he wrote Morgan a letter, showing his own warmhearted generosity.\n",
      "After complimenting Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress, too, the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris, but that he knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required, if it was done at all.\n",
      "`` As Mrs. Morris may be in some want before that time'', Lafayette continued, `` I am going to trouble you with a commission which I beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy.\n",
      "If she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of Congress, it would not become a stranger, unknown to her, to offer himself for that purpose.\n",
      "But you could( as from yourself) tell her that you had friends who, being with the army, don't know what to do with their money and would willingly let her have one or many thousand dollars''.\n",
      "Apparently still sensitive about the idea with which General Gates had approached him at Saratoga, namely, that George Washington be replaced, Morgan was vehement in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around Philadelphia.\n",
      "Richard Peters, Secretary of the Board of War, thought Morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel.\n",
      "Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot against Washington.\n",
      "Peters insisted that this impression was a great misunderstanding, and evidently, from the quarrel, obtained an unfavorable impression of Morgan's judgment.\n",
      "Such a situation regarding the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's chances for promotion when that matter came before the group later on.\n",
      "In late December, the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley Forge, and although the distance was only 13 miles, the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather, the barefooted and almost naked men.\n",
      "The position of the new camp was admirably selected and well fortified, its easily defensible nature being one good reason why Howe did not attack it.\n",
      "Besides helping to prevent the movement of the British to the west, Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between Howe's forces and the farmers, thus threatening the vital subsistence of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary supplies extremely hazardous.\n",
      "In order to see that this hindering situation remained effective, Washington detached several bodies of his troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area.\n",
      "Morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the Schuylkill River, with instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy.\n",
      "The headquarters of Morgan was on a farm, said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British, a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for British gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental currency.\n",
      "For example, he captured some persons from York County, who with teams were taking to Philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife, and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household goods.\n",
      "Morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its thankful owners, but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free.\n",
      "Morgan complained to Washington about the men detailed to him for scouting duty, most of them he said being useless.\n",
      "`` They straggle at such a rate'', he told the commander-in-chief, `` that if the enemy were enterprising, they might get two from us, when we would take one of them, which makes me wish General Howe would go on, lest any incident happen to us''.\n",
      "The mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the troops at Valley Forge could be handled by a subordinate, he felt, so like Henry Knox, equally loyal to Washington, who went to Boston at this time, Morgan received permission to visit his home in Virginia for several weeks.\n",
      "But Morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a William Pickman in Salem, Massachusetts, apparently an acquaintance, praising Washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were `` opposed by the general current of the people to exalt General Gates at the expense of General Washington was injurious to the latter.\n",
      "It is doubtful if Morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children, for his pay, as shown by the War Department Abstracts of early 1778 was $75 a month as a colonel, and that apt to be delayed.\n",
      "He was shown a warm welcome regardless, and spent the time in Winchester recuperating from his ailment, enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were, of course, run down.\n",
      "His neighbors celebrated his return, even if it was only temporary, and Morgan was especially gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend, Isaac Lane, who told him, `` A man that has so often left all that is dear to him, as thou hast, to serve thy country, must create a sympathetic feeling in every patriotic heart''.\n",
      "On May 6th, Morgan, who had returned, received from Washington orders to `` send out patrols under vigilant officers'' to keep near the enemy.\n",
      "`` The reason for this'', the orders said, `` is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day.\n",
      "The Frenchman had been ordered to approach the enemy's lines, harass them and get intelligence of their movements.\n",
      "Interestingly enough, the order transmitted to Morgan through Alexander Hamilton also informed him that `` A party of Indians will join the party to be sent from your command at Whitemarsh, and act with them''.\n",
      "Washington evidently was anxious for Morgan to be cautious as well as aggressive, for on May 17th, 18th and 20th he admonished the leader of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert.\n",
      "Obviously the commander-in-chief had confidence that Morgan would furnish him good intelligence too, for on the 23rd of May, he told Morgan that the British were prepared to move, perhaps in the night, and asked Morgan to have two of his best horses ready to dispatch to General Smallwood with the intelligence obtained.\n",
      "Meantime, however, this same General Smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army.\n",
      "Colonel Benjamin Ford wrote to Morgan from Wilmington that he understood a Mrs. Sanderson from Maryland had obtained permission from Smallwood to visit Philadelphia, and would return on May 26th, escorted by several officers from Maryland `` belonging to the new levies in the British service''.\n",
      "Ford urged Morgan to capture these men, who, he thought, might be disguised as Quakers or peasants.\n",
      "Morgan took the suggested steps, but when Mrs. Sanderson appeared, there was nobody with her but her husband, whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned.\n",
      "But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general.\n",
      "A letter of a few days later from Washington's aide to Morgan stated, `` His Excellency is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion''.\n",
      "For by now the original cause of the quarrel, Philip's seizure of Gascony, was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to the other.\n",
      "Even so, Edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with it.\n",
      "It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope.\n",
      "It was not merely a hunger for `` money, gold and precious objects'' that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war to an end;;\n",
      "the pope was playing a dangerous game, with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears, and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs.\n",
      "When the negotiations began, his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily in abeyance, and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who, under Charles of Valois, the papal vicar of Tuscany, were so valuable in the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies.\n",
      "If his circumspection in regard to Philip's sensibilities went so far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of Amadee's daughter, Agnes, to the son of the dauphin of Vienne -- a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas, for Savoy and Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides -- for fear that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French coalition, he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return of Gascony to Edward, even though, as he admitted to the English ambassadors, he had been advised that the original cession was invalid.\n",
      "On the other hand, he did not want to offend Edward either, and he found himself in a very difficult position.\n",
      "The French were now occupying Gascony and Flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited them by a breach of the feudal contract.\n",
      "Boniface had to uphold the sacredness of the feudal contract at all costs, for it was only as suzerain of Sicily and of the Patrimony of Peter that he had any justification for his Italian wars, but in the English-Scottish-French triangle it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other two.\n",
      "Because of these involvements in the matter at stake, Boniface lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter, and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient reason why the English embassies to the Curia proved so fruitless.\n",
      "But when the situation was so complicated that even Nogaret, one of the principal actors in the drama, could misinterpret the pope's motives, it is possible that Othon and his companions, equally baffled, attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause.\n",
      "`` Tact'', by its very derivation, implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other people, but the author of Clericis Laicos and Unam Sanctam, the wielder of the two swords, the papal sun of which the imperial moon was but a dim reflection, the peer of Caesar and vice-regent of Christ, was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten what they were like.\n",
      "He was a learned and brilliant man, one of the best jurists in Europe and with flashes of penetrating insight, and yet in his dealings with other people, particularly when he tried to be ingratiating, he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives.\n",
      "This lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men as Pierre Flotte and his associates, that `` brilliant group of mediocre men'', as Powicke calls them, who provided the brains for the French embassy that came to Rome under the nominal leadership of the archbishop of Narbonne, the duke of Burgundy, and the count of St.-Pol.\n",
      "They had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence and astuteness, they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles like Othon or even the older generation of clerks like Hotham, and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized.\n",
      "Boniface was later to explain to the English that Robert of Burgundy and Guy De St.-Pol were easy enough to do business with;;\n",
      "it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a Frenchman or with a devil.\n",
      "To the pope, head of the universal Church, to the duke of Burgundy, taking full advantage of his position on the borders of France and of the Empire, or to Othon, who found it quite natural that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary and to the count of Savoy for Grandson, Flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely incomprehensible.\n",
      "when the pope, trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature, said to him, `` You have already taken Normandy.\n",
      "Do you want to drive the king of England from all his overseas possessions''??\n",
      "Loyal and unscrupulous, with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies, he outmatched the English diplomats time and time again until, by a kind of poetic justice, he fell at the battle of Courtrai, the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate Flemings.\n",
      "The English, relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior diplomatic skill, were also hampered in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home.\n",
      "He was unable to send any more help to his allies on the Continent, and during the next few years many of them, left to resist French pressure unaided, surrendered to the inevitable and made their peace with Philip.\n",
      "The defeat and death of Adolf of Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked to the disadvantage of the English, for all the efforts to revive the anti-French coalition came to nothing when Philip made an alliance with the new king of the Romans.\n",
      "In spite of the armistice negotiated by Amadee two years earlier, the war between Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis of Savoy was still going on, and although little is known about it, that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against French expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict.\n",
      "But although in many of these discussions Othon and Amadee might have been tempted to consider their own interests as well as those of the king, Edward's confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders of the embassy.\n",
      "Amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship with the king, but Othon, who at sixty seems still to have been a simple knight, merited his position solely by his own character and ability.\n",
      "The younger men, Vere, and Pembroke, who was also Edward's cousin and whose Lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that caused Edward of Carnarvon's irreverent friend, Piers Gaveston, to nickname him `` Joseph the Jew'', were relatively new to the game of diplomacy, but Pontissara had been on missions to Rome before, and Hotham, a man of great learning, `` jocund in speech, agreeable to meet, of honest religion, and pleasing in the eyes of all'', and an archbishop to boot, was as reliable and experienced as Othon himself.\n",
      "But all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards were the heads of it, for they were the only ones who were empowered to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably absent.\n",
      "This also gave them the unpleasant duty of being spokesmen for the mission, and they could foresee that that would not be easy.\n",
      "Underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain, the king of France, in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate Scots.\n",
      "This was a doubly bitter blow to the king.\n",
      "In the eyes of those who still cared for such things, it was a reflection on his honor, and it gave further grounds for complaint to his overtaxed subjects, who were already grumbling -- although probably not in Latin -- `` Non est lex sana Quod regi sit mea lana''.\n",
      "Bad relations between England and Flanders brought hard times to the shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded Flemish cities, and while the English, so far, had done no more than grumble, Othon had seen what the discontent might lead to, for before he left the Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops, and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued.\n",
      "In all the talk of feudal rights, the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers, nor was it easy to do so, for all along the road to Italy they passed the Florentine pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from England and rough Flemish cloth, the former to be spun and woven by the Arte Della Lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the Arte Della Calimala with the pigment recently discovered in Asia Minor by one of their members, Bernardo Rucellai, the secret of which they jealously kept for themselves.\n",
      "These chatty merchants made amusing and instructive traveling companions, for their business took them to all four corners of the globe, and Florentine gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the Inferno will prove.\n",
      "A northern ambassador, willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open, could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead at the Curia.\n",
      "They had other topics of conversation, besides their news from courts and fairs, which were of interest to Othon, the builder of castles in Wales and churches in his native country.\n",
      "Behind him lay the Low Countries, where men were still completing the cathedrals that a later Florentine would describe as `` a malediction of little tabernacles, one on top of the other, with so many pyramids and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all, for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble'';;\n",
      "the Low Countries, where the Middle Ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when Charles the Bold of Burgundy met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of Grandson.\n",
      "It usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right people or there were only a few wrong people in the town.\n",
      "Alfred wanted to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place.\n",
      "My father would have done it if it hadn't been for my mother, who had a fear of being in debt to anyone -- even Alfred Alpert.\n",
      "In spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about Alfred.\n",
      "They had my mother's opinion of him: that he was too sharp or a little too good to be true.\n",
      "I don't know how and I don't know why but the two stores, the one in Margaretville and the one in Fleischmanns that had been set up as a partnership, were dissolved, separated from each other.\n",
      "Everything was all very friendly, except when it came to Harry, the youngest brother.\n",
      "Alfred, who was a good deal older than Harry, had treated him like a son, and when Harry decided to stay in business with Lew instead of going with Alfred, Alfred looked on the decision as a betrayal.\n",
      "From that day on he never spoke to Harry or to Lew, or to Lew's two boys, Mort and Jimmy.\n",
      "It was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and Tessie and Alfred found out that they didn't know each other.\n",
      "The store was their marriage, and when Alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together.\n",
      "Tessie, everybody thought, was a strong woman, but she was only strong because she had Alfred to lean on.\n",
      "Instead she waited for Alfred to get better and take care of her.\n",
      "Alfred knew that, too.\n",
      "I remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't.\n",
      "Alfred began to put his affairs in order, and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage.\n",
      "One day Alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me.\n",
      "My father, a wise man, asked him not to.\n",
      "if he wanted to leave me something let it be a trinket, nothing else.\n",
      "By leaving me everything he wouldn't be doing me a favor, my father told him, and he didn't want to see his daughter involved in a lawsuit.\n",
      "He didn't want Alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would be, and Alfred understood.\n",
      "Alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home.\n",
      "Solemnly he walked me back to Alfred's house without a word passing between us.\n",
      "I sat down to wait, and I watched Tessie Alpert, who hadn't moved or said a word but kept staring out of the window.\n",
      "For a few minutes there was nothing to hear.\n",
      "Alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital.\n"

      "I don't think he ever got to drink any of it.\n",

      "He came to Fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought him to America from Russia.\n",
      "Banks the Butcher took Meltzer the Scholar as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the Commentaries of the Talmud in order to live.\n",
      "The daughter, Lilly, was a very good friend of mine and I always had hopes that someday she and Meltzer would find each other.\n",
      "They lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do, but the sad realities of Lilly's life and the fact that Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful thinking.\n",
      "Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard father, a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade.\n",
      "perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks.\n",
      "She was the opposite of everything she should have been -- a positive pole in a negative home, a living reaction of warmth and kindness to the harsh reality of her father.\n",

      "Every chance I got I left the hotel to visit Lilly.\n",
      "I was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of Meltzer lightened.\n",

      "To me it was a game, to her it was the deadly seriousness of life.\n",
      "I wanted to help so that we could find time to play.\n",

      "It wasn't hard to understand.\n",
      "She had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the street.\n",

      "It was unexpected, unexpected because Lilly walked with her head bent down, down, and her mark of friendship was to look into your face.\n",
      "childishness compared to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins.\n",

      "The turn of the century, or to be more precise, the two decades preceeding and following it, marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship.\n",
      "In archaeology, for example, the contributions of Frederick Haverfield and Reginald Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria County Histories raised the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early English historian.\n",
      "Even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development.\n",
      "It was therefore not until the publication of J.H. Round's `` The Settlement Of The South And East Saxons'', and W.H. Stevenson's `` Dr. Guest And The English Conquest Of South Britain'', that a scientific basis for place-name studies was established.\n",
      "Although because of the important achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology and place-names, the editorial principles laid down by Stevenson in his great edition of Asser and in his Crawford Charters were a distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved upon today.\n",
      "In sum, it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century.\n",
      "And it is this, particularly the establishment of archaeology and place-name studies on a scientific basis, which are immediately pertinent to the Saxon Shore.\n",
      "Charles Plummer in the introduction and notes to his splendid edition of Bede voiced some early doubts concerning the `` elaborate superstructure'' they raised up over the slim foundations afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest.\n",
      "'' It is also worthy of note that Lot cited both Kemble and Lappenberg with favor in that article.\n",
      "It would seem that the wheel had turned full circle.\n",
      "In fact, modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the nineteenth century.\n",
      "Most now admit that Bede, Gildas, Nennius and The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early English history that Guest, Freeman and Green thought them to be.\n",
      "On the other hand, the consensus of opinion is that, used with caution and in conjunction with other types of evidence, the native sources still provide a valid rough outline for the English settlement of southern Britain.\n",
      "As Sir Charles Oman once said, `` it is no longer fashionable to declare that we can say nothing certain about Old English origins''.\n",
      "Despite the rejection of the traditional accounts on many points of detail, as late as 1948 it was still possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden( beginning in ca. 450) influx of Germans as the type of invasions.\n",
      "They, however much they were in disagreement with the late Victorians over the method by which Britain was Germanized, agreed with them that the end result was the complete extinction of the previous Celtic population and civilization.\n",
      "But beginning, for all practical purposes, with Frederick Seebohm's English Village Community scholars have had to reckon with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between Roman and Anglo-Saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions.\n",
      "Largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory has maintained its position although Seebohm has always found supporters.\n",
      "H.L. Gray in his English Field Systems and Zachrisson's Romans, Kelts And Saxons defended in part the Seebohm thesis while at the present time H.P.R. Finberg and Gordon Copley seem to fall into the Celtic survivalist camp.\n",
      "Most scholars, while willing to accept a survival( revival??\n",
      "Therefore, it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us.\n",
      "As a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual Germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of their work, e.g. Seebohm, Gray and Finberg, tends to obscure their sympathies.\n",
      "Those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions in a more general way, like T.W. Shore and Arthur Wade-Evans, are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful Germanic penetration into Britain.\n",
      "Wade-Evans, in fact, denies that there were any Anglo-Saxon invasions at all other than a minor Jutish foray in A.D. 514.\n",
      "It is no longer possible to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the invasions almost automatically produces a `` shore occupied by'' interpretation.\n",
      "Everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has been willing to accept Lappenberg or Kemble's position on that point.\n",
      "One reason is, of course, that the new scepticism has been willing to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in the traditional sources.\n",
      "Even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion.\n",
      "What they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of Britain received Germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of England.\n",
      "That is, there was no trace of Anglo-Saxons in Britain as early as the late third century, to which time the archaeological evidence for the erection of the Saxon Shore forts was beginning to point.\n",
      "In the face of a clear judgment from archaeology, therefore, it became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the `` shore settled by'' theory.\n",
      "In recent years, however, a wind of change seems to be blowing through early English historical circles.\n",
      "The great increase in the amount of archaeological activity, and therefore information, in the years immediately preceeding and following the Second World War has brought to light data which has changed the complection of the Saxon Shore dispute.\n",
      "What exactly are we trying to prove??\n",
      "We know that the Saxon Shore was a phenonenon of late Roman defensive policy;;\n",
      "in other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain.\n",
      "We also know that the Saxon Shore as reflected in the Notitia was created as a part of the Theodosian reorganization of Britain( post A.D. 369).\n",
      "My argument is that there was no Saxon Shore prior to that time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius.\n",
      "Therefore, what we must prove or disprove is that there were Saxons, in the broad sense in which we must construe the word, in the area of the Saxon Shore at the time it was called the Saxon Shore.\n",
      "In Britain, obviously, the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the Saxon Shore region are bound to be Saxon.\n",
      "It is a matter of trying to sort out an earlier fourth-century Saxon element from the later, fifth-century mainstream of Anglo-Saxon invasions.\n",
      "This, naturally, will be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence in this period, with some fortunate exceptions, is insufficient for precise chronological purposes.\n",
      "It might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question;;\n",
      "namely, is the idea that there were Saxon mercenaries in England at all reasonable??\n",
      "Wood took the proposal to Chief of Staff Hugh L. Scott, who passed it on to Baker a month before the actual declaration of war against Germany.\n",
      "The Secretary of War gave his assent after studying the history of the draft in the American Civil War as well as the British volunteer system in World War 1.\n",
      "He concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable moral effects of the British reliance on enlistment only -- `` where the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning white feathers on reluctant young men, orators preaching hate of the Germans, and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist out of motives of revenge and retaliation''.\n",
      "Baker took the plan to Wilson who said: `` Baker, this is plainly right on any ground.\n",
      "Start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if I am obliged to go to Congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration''.\n",
      "The result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually ready long before the country knew that the device was to take the place of the volunteering method which Theodore Roosevelt favored.\n",
      "Before the Draft Act was passed Baker had confidentially briefed governors, sheriffs, and prospective draft board members on the administration of the measure -- and the confidence was kept so well that only one newspaper learned what was going on.\n",
      "It was Baker, working through Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder and Major Hugh S.( `` Old Ironpants'') Johnson, who arranged for a secret printing by the million of selective service blanks -- again before the Act was passed -- until corridors in the Government Printing Office were full and the basement of the Washington Post Office was stacked to the ceiling.\n",
      "General Crowder proposed that Regular Army officers select the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation;;\n",
      "it was Baker who thought of lessening the shock, which conscription always brings to a country, by substituting `` Greetings from your neighbors'' for the recruiting sergeant, and registration in familiar voting places rather than at military installations.\n",
      "Democrat Stanley H. Dent, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, declined to introduce the bill.\n",
      "In the judgment of Chief of Staff Scott it was ironic that the draft policy of a Democratic President, aimed at Germany, had to be pushed through the House of Representatives by the ranking minority member of the Military Affairs Committee -- a Republican Jew born in Germany!!\n",
      "Secretary of War Baker, blindfolded, put his hand into a large glass bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called.\n",
      "He was the first of 2,800,000 called to the Army through the selective service system.\n",
      "It was one thing to call men to the colors;;\n",
      "it was another to house, feed, and train them.\n",
      "At Camp Taylor in Kentucky a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had been standing in Mississippi forests one week before.\n",
      "In later years Josephus Daniels was to claim that World War 1, was the first in American history in which there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers.\n",
      "It was the first American war in which the death rate from disease was lower than that from battle, due to the provision of trained medical personnel( of the 200,000 officers, 42,000 were physicians), compulsory vaccination, rigorous camp sanitation, and adequate hospital facilities.\n",
      "in the United States 300,000 succumbed to it.\n",
      "during the eight-week blitz attack 25,000 soldiers died from the disease and the death rate( formerly 5 per year per 1,000 men) increased almost fifty times to 4 per week per 1,000 men.\n",
      "Both Secretary of War Baker and Secretary of Navy Daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of men who had been removed from their home environment.\n",
      "Their policy ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a libertine, and that in sex affairs `` God-given passion'' was a proof of manliness.\n",
      "His assignment was not a new one because Baker had sent him to the Mexican border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline, drunkenness, and venereal disease in American military camps.\n",
      "Fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of saloons and houses of prostitution, with filles de joie from all over the country flocking to San Antonio, Laredo, and El Paso to `` woman the cribs''.\n",
      "He also ascertained that many officers were indifferent to the problem, including Commanding General Frederick Funston who gave Fosdick the nickname of `` Reverend''.\n",
      "On the basis of the long chronicle of military history Funston and his brethren assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a mission like Fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder.\n",
      "During the brief Mexican venture Fosdick's report to the Secretary recommended a definite stand by the War Department against the saloon and the excesses of prostitution.\n",
      "Fosdick insisted that a strong word was needed from Washington, and it was immediately forthcoming.\n",
      "Baker put the `` cribs'' and the saloons out of bounds, ordered the co-operation of military officers with local law authorities, and told communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions were restored.\n",
      "Both Baker and Fosdick knew that a substitute was necessary, that a verboten approach was not the real answer.\n",
      "They were aware that soldiers went to town, in more ways than one, because of the monotony of camp life, to find the only release available in the absence of movies, reading rooms, and playing fields with adequate athletic equipment.\n",
      "Both knew that when trains stopped at Texan crossroads bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if they had any reading material to spare, even a newspaper.\n",
      "There was no time in the short Mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future.\n",
      "When the United States entered the First World War Baker made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps in which prostitution was outlawed.\n",
      "New Orleans had a notorious red-light district extending over twenty-eight city blocks, and the business-minded mayor of the city journeyed to Washington to present the case for `` the God-given right of men to be men''.\n",
      "When Fosdick showed the letter to Baker his negative response was: `` For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the President or he'll stop the war''.\n",
      "Ultimately Fosdick's `` Fit to fight'' slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district in the United States was closed, a hundred and ten of them.\n",
      "The result was that the rate of venereal disease in the American Army was the lowest in our military history.\n",
      "Affirmatively Baker worked on the premise that `` young men spontaneously prefer to be decent, and that opportunities for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations''.\n",
      "The wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including the YMCA, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, the American Library Association, and the Playground and Recreation Association -- private societies which voluntarily performed the job that was taken over almost entirely by the Special Services Division of the Army itself in World War 2.\n",
      "Under Fosdick the first executive officer of the CTCA was Richard Byrd, whose name in later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes.\n",
      "The CTCA program of activities was profuse: William Farnum and Mary Pickford on the screen, Elsie Janis and Harry Lauder on the stage, books provided by the American Library Association, full equipment for games and sports -- except that no `` bones'' were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played on any floor and known as `` African golf''.\n",
      "The CTCA distributed a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited renditions of the selections found therein, plus a number of others whose lyrics were more earthy -- from `` Johnny Get Your Gun'' to `` Keep The Home Fires Burning'' to `` Mademoiselle From Armentieres''.\n",
      "The sense of relationship overreaches the historical truth that Shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.\n",
      "It transcends the glaring fact that the Elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas the Greeks kept the two modes severely distinct.\n",
      "Elsinore seems to lie in a range of Mycenae, and the fate of Orestes resounds in that of Hamlet.\n",
      "It is not between Euripides and Shakespeare that the western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life.\n",
      "Shakespeare is closer to Sophocles than he is to Pope and Voltaire.\n",
      "To say this is to set aside the realness of time.\n",
      "The modes of the imagination implicit in Athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age of Descartes and Newton.\n",
      "It is only then that the ancient habits of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience were abandoned.\n",
      "With the Discours de la methode and the Principia the things undreamt of in Horatio's philosophy seem to pass from the world.\n",

      "Its sphere is that of royal courts, dynastic quarrels, and vaulting ambitions.\n",
      "The same metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to Oedipus and Macbeth because they applied also to Alcibiades and Essex.\n",
      "Greek and Elizabethan life and, to a certain extent, the life of Versailles shared this character of intense `` publicity''.\n",
      "With the rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs shifted from the public to the private.\n",
      "It served also as a literary form exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture.\n",
      "I have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements with regard to the character of the Greek and Elizabethan public.\n",
      "They order the manifold levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars.\n",
      "I mean such concepts as the presence of the supernatural in human affairs, the sacraments of grace and divine retribution, the idea of preordainment( the oracle over Oedipus, the prophecy of the witches to Macbeth, or God's covenant with His people in Athalie).\n",
      "I refer to the notion that the structure of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality play set in motion by the gods for our instruction.\n",
      "These conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time of Aeschylus to that of Shakespeare.\n",
      "After the seventeenth century the audience ceased to be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar.\n",
      "They were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable.\n",
      "From this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting Greek and Shakespearean drama into a new total form, capable of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses.\n",
      "The dream of achieving a synthesis between the Sophoclean and the Shakespearean genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time of Shelley and Victor Hugo to that of Bayreuth.\n",
      "The conventions into which the romantics tried to breath life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling.\n",
      "But the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works, and these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age of Ibsen and Chekhov.\n",
      "The wedding of the Hellenic to the northern genius was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought.\n",
      "Goethe believed that the Germanic spirit, with its grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance, should be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the Hellenic.\n",
      "On the narrower ground of poetic form, he felt that in the drama of the future the Greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to the Shakespearean vision of tragic will.\n",
      "The third Act of Faust 2, is a formal celebration of the union between the Germanic and the classic, between the spirit of Euripides and that of romantic drama.\n",
      "The motif of Faust's love for Helen of Troy goes back to the sources of the Faustian legend.\n",
      "It tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty.\n",
      "There can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all, in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible.\n",
      "It is thus that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's Faustus.\n",
      "Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends.\n",
      "Faust rescuing Helen from Menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance Europe restoring to life the classic tradition.\n",
      "The necromantic change from the palace at Sparta to Faust's Gothic castle directs us to the aesthetic meaning of the myth -- the translation of antique drama into Shakespearean and romantic guise.\n",
      "When Quiney and William Parsons wrote to Greville in 1593 asking his consent in the election for bailiff, they sent the letter to Mr. William Sawnders, attendant on the worshipful Mr. Thomas Bushell at Marston.\n",
      "He refused his consent to the election of Quiney as bailiff in 1592, but gave it at the request of the recorder, his cousin Sir Fulke Greville.\n",
      "At Milcote on November 3, 1597, the aldermen asked him to support their petition for a new charter.\n",
      "Sturley wrote to Quiney that Sir Edward `` gave his allowance and liking thereof, and affied unto us his best endeavour, so that his rights be preserved'', and that `` Sir Edward saith we shall not be at any fault for money for prosecuting the cause, for himself will procure it and lay it down for us for the time''.\n",
      "Greville proposed Quiney as the fittest man `` for the following of the cause and to attend him in the matter'', and at his suggestion the corporation allowed Quiney two shillings a day.\n",
      "`` If you can firmly make the good knight sure to pleasure our Corporation'', Sturley wrote, `` besides that ordinary allowance for your diet you shall have 20 for recompence''.\n",
      "In his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January 24, 1597/8, Sturley asked Quiney especially that `` theare might( be) bi Sir Ed. Grev. some meanes made to the Knightes of the Parliament for an ease and discharge of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne is like to be charged, and I assure u I am in great feare and doubte bi no meanes hable to paie.\n",
      "Sir Ed. Gre. is gonne to Brestowe and from thence to Lond. as I heare, who verie well knoweth our estates and wil be willinge to do us ani good''.\n",
      "The corporation voted on September 27, 1598, that Quiney should ride to London about the suit to Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the Exchequer, for discharging of the tax and subsidy.\n",
      "He had been in London for several weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare on October 25.\n",
      "Sturley on November 4 answered a letter from Quiney written on October 25 which imported, wrote Sturley, `` that our countriman Mr. Wm. Shak. would procure us monei: which I will like of as I shall heare when, wheare& howe: and I prai let not go that occasion if it mai sort to ani indifferent condicions.\n",
      "Allso that if monei might be had for 30 or 40 a lease& might be procured''.\n",
      "Sturley quoted Quiney as having written on November 1 that if he had `` more monei presente much might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd, ij faires more, with tole of corne, bestes, and sheepe, and a matter of more valewe then all that''.\n",
      "Sturley thought that this matter might be `` the rest of the tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne''.\n",
      "He suggested offering half to Sir Edward, fearing lest `` he shall thinke it to good for us and procure it for himselfe, as he served us the last time''.\n",
      "This refers to what had happened after the Earl of Warwick died in 1590, when the town petitioned Burghley for the right to name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but Greville bought the lordship for himself.\n",
      "Sturley's allusion probably explains why Greville took out the patent in the names of Best and Wells, for Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as `` a scrivener within Temple Bar, that deals in many matters for my L. Essex'' through Sir Gelly Merrick, especially in `` causes that he would not be known of''.\n",
      "Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October 29 and again perhaps the next day, since the bearer of the letter, the bailiff, was expected to reach London on November 1.\n",
      "In his second letter the old mercer advised his son `` to bye some such warys as yow may selle presentlye with profet.\n",
      "This seems to refer, not to the loan Richard had asked for, but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare.\n",
      "Richard Quiney the younger, a schoolboy of eleven, wrote a letter in Latin asking his father to buy copybooks( `` chartaceos libellos)'') for him and his brother.\n",
      "His mother Bess, who could not write herself, reminded her husband through Sturley to buy the apron he had promised her and `` a suite of hattes for 5 boies the yongst lined& trimmed with silke''( for John, only a year old).\n",
      "A letter signed `` Isabell Bardall'' entreated `` Good Cozen'' Quiney to find her stepson Adrian, son of George Bardell, a place in London with some handicraftsman.\n",
      "William Parsons and William Walford, drapers, asked Quiney to see to business matters in London.\n",
      "Daniel Baker deluged his `` Unckle Quyne'' with requests to pay money for him to drapers in Watling Street and at the Two Cats in Canning Street.\n",
      "His letter of October 26 named two of the men about whom Quiney had written to Shakespeare the day before.\n",
      "& synce I did write unto him to dessier him to paie 10 for mee which standeth mee greatly uppon to have paide.\n",
      "& 20 more Mr. Peeter Rowswell tooke order with his master to paie for mee''.\n",
      "He asked Quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and, if not, to send to the lodging of Sir Edward and entreat him to pay what he owed.\n",
      "Baker added: `` I pray you delivre these inclosed Letters And Comend mee to Mr. Rychard Mytton whoe I know will ffreind mee for the payment of this monei''.\n",
      "Further letters in November mention that Sir Edward paid forty pounds.\n",
      "Stratford's petition to the queen declared that two great fires had burnt two hundred houses in the town, with household goods, to the value of twelve thousand pounds.\n",
      "The chancellor of the Exchequer wrote on the petition: `` in myn opinion it is very resonable and conscionable for hir maiestie to graunt in relief of this towne twise afflicted and almost wasted by fire''.\n",
      "another I bought there to bring me home 7 weeks;;\n",
      "He was allowed forty-four pounds in all, including fees to the masters of requests, Mr. Fanshawe of the Exchequer, the solicitor general, and other officials and their clerks.\n",
      "If he borrowed money from Shakespeare or with his help, he would now have been able to repay the loan.\n",
      "Since more is known about Quiney than about any other acquaintance of Shakespeare in Stratford, his career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602.\n",
      "Accompanied by `` Master Greene our solicitor''( Thomas Greene of the Middle Temple, Shakespeare's `` cousin''), Quiney tried to consult Sir Edward Coke, attorney general, and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper `` that we might have access to their master for his counsel butt colde nott have him att Leasure by the reason of thees trobles''( the Essex rising on February 8).\n",
      "He set down that `` I gave Mr. Greene a pynte of muskadell and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have his company to Master Attorney''.\n",
      "After returning Stratford he drew up a defense of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it, and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and Shakespeare's father.\n",
      "No one, he wrote, took any corn of Greville's, for his bailiff of husbandry `` swore a greate oathe thatt who soe came to put hys hande into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande behynde hym''.\n",
      "After Quiney was elected bailiff in September, 1601, without Greville's approval, Greene wrote him that Coke had promised to be of counsel for Stratford and had advised `` that the office of bayly may be exercised as it is taken upon you,( Sr. Edwardes his consent not beinge hadd to the swearinge of you)''.\n",
      "Asked by the townsmen to cease his suit, Greville had answered that `` hytt shulde coste hym 500 first& sayed it must be tried ether before my Lorde Anderson in the countrey or his uncle Ffortescue in the exchequer with whom he colde more prevaile then we''.\n",
      "Lady Greville, daughter of the late Lord Chancellor Bromley and niece of Sir John Fortescue, was offered twenty pounds by the townsmen to make peace;;\n",
      "she `` labored& thought she shuld effecte'' it but her husband said that `` we shuld wynne it by the sworde''.\n",
      "His servant Robin Whitney threatened Quiney, who had Whitney bound to `` the good abaringe'' to keep the peace.\n",
      "A report of Sr. Edw Grevyles minaces to the Baileefe Aldermen& Burgesses of Stratforde'' tells how Quiney was injured by Greville's men: `` in the tyme Mr. Ryc' Quyney was bayleefe ther came some of them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher thei druncke& drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the Baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order& comminge by in hurley burley came into the howse& commawnded the peace to be kept butt colde nott prevayle& in hys endevor to sticle the brawle had his heade grevouselye brooken by one of hys( Greville's) men whom nether hymselfe( Greville) punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished but with a shewe to turne them awaye& enterteyned agayne''.\n",
      "The fall of Rome, the discovery of precious metals, and the Protestant Reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed.\n",
      "They react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law.\n",
      "A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law is inimical to the numerical majority.\n",
      "A nation may go to war on some trifling pretext, when in reality it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake.\n",
      "When the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence, he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides.\n",
      "Adams firmly contended that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history.\n",
      "Indeed, he concluded that `` geographical conditions have exercised a great, possibly a preponderating, influence over man's destiny''.\n",
      "The failure of Greece to reach the imperial destiny that Periclean Athens had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical conformation.\n",
      "Brooks Adams was consistent in his admonishments to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess.\n",
      "However, as a practicing historian, he, himself, has left few clues to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history.\n",
      "In fact, if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness of his historicism, they must be based on scanty evidence.\n",
      "What evidence is available would seem to indicate that Brooks, unlike his older brother Henry, had most of the methodological vices usually found in the amateur.\n",
      "A credulousness, a distaste for documentation, an uncritical reliance on contemporary accounts, and a proneness to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public.\n",
      "This is not to assume that his work was without merit, but the validity of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be considered against this background of an unprofessional approach.\n",
      "His credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to The Emancipation Of Massachusetts, which purports to examine the trials of Moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the Israelite exodus from Egypt and the leadership of the Puritan clergy in colonial New England.\n",
      "In light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement, particularly coming from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views.\n",
      "The desire to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique smacks more of the propagandist than the historian.\n",
      "A similar amateurish characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources.\n",
      "If he found data that fitted his general plan, he used it and counted his sources trustworthy.\n",
      "Adams depended largely on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in England, claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because there were no newspapers.\n",
      "This is certainly an irrational dogmatism, in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth century on twentieth-century terms.\n",
      "Moreover, he rejects the contemporary accounts of Englishmen, casually adjudging them to be distorted by prejudice because `` the opinions of Englishmen are of no great value''.\n",
      "In all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made no pretense at being an impartial historian.\n",
      "Impartiality to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis.\n",
      "Ranke and his disciples had reduced history to a profession of dullness;;\n",
      "He wrote eloquently to William James that impartial history was not only impossible but undesirable.\n",
      "If the historian was convinced of his own correctness, then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by disturbing facts.\n",
      "It was history that must be in error, not the historian.\n",
      "It was this basic trait that separated Adams from the ranks of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what was his most serious offense against the historical method -- namely, the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting it to the test of facts.\n",
      "No page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization.\n",
      "One example of this was his assertion that `` all servile revolts must be dealt with by physical force''.\n",
      "There is no explanation of terms nor a qualification that most such revolts have been dealt with by force -- only a bald dogmatism that they must, because of some undefined compulsion, be so repelled.\n",
      "On matters of race he was similarly inflexible: `` Most of the modern Latin races seem to have inherited the rigidity of the Roman mind''.\n",
      "He cites the French Revolution as typifying this rigidity but makes no mention of the Italians, who have been able to adapt to all types of circumstances.\n",
      "He pontificates that `` one of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value of women in men's eyes''.\n",
      "It made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion.\n",
      "J. T. Shotwell was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade, and he urged Adams to `` transform his essay into a real history, embodying not merely those facts which fit into his theory, but also the modifications and exceptions''.\n",
      "A. M. Wergeland called the Adams method literally antihistorical, while Clive Day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight factual evidence.\n",
      "Moreover, stated Day, `` He always omits facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis''.\n",
      "Even D. A. Wasson, who compared The Emancipation Of Massachusetts to the lifting of a fog from ancient landscapes, was also forced to admit the methodological deficiencies of the author.\n",
      "In summary, Brooks Adams felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature.\n",
      "Moreover, he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history.\n",
      "However, despite the insight of many of his observations, his own conclusions are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the correct research methods.\n",
      "In the final analysis his contribution to American historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights into religion, economics, and Darwinism, the three factors which conditioned his search for a law of history.\n",
      "But it was nothing more than that.\n",
      "he simply did not believe that a Creator intervened or interfered in human affairs.\n",
      "Certainly, he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its influence on the flow of history, but he must not confuse the natural and the mundane with the divine.\n",
      "Adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment.\n",
      "Students of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that there was, indeed, a direct connection.\n",
      "But Adams was one of the first to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor behind religion.\n",
      "It was this fear which explained the development of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease the angry deities.\n",
      "To keep themselves entrenched in power, the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle.\n",
      "It was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business.\n",
      "`` The Germans in the fourth century were a very simple race, who comprehended little of natural laws, and who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention.\n",
      "Adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between God and man.\n",
      "Thus, the Church was born and because of its intrinsic character was soon identified as a conservative institution, determined to resist the forces of change, to identify itself with the political rulers, and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses.\n",
      "These basic ideas concerning the nature of religion were, Adams believed, some of the major keys to the understanding of history and the movement of society.\n",
      "Despite their adherence to the status quo, the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge.\n",
      "In The Law Of Civilization And Decay Brooks Adams traced this evolution, always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more rational, the substance remained unchanged.\n",
      "Yet, the idea imbedded in each was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of God.\n",
      "To Adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire culture of the race was one of imagination, and it is largely the admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar religiosity -- a sentiment he would have probably denied.\n",
      "Stephens had written his classic `` incidents of travel'' about these regions a hundred years before, and Catherwood, who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece, had drawn the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text.\n",
      "He had not yet undertaken the great exploit of his later years, the rediscovery of the ancient Inca highway, the route of Pizarro in Peru, but he had climbed to the original El Dorado, the Andean lake of Guatemala, and he had scaled the southern Sierra Nevada with its Tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald mines of Muzo.\n",
      "As a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters of the Amazon, he had collected specimens for Mexican museums, and he had taken to the London zoo a live quetzal, the sacred bird of the old Mayans.\n",
      "Moreover, he had spent six months on the Galapagos islands, among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found there, and now and then he would disappear into some small island of the West Indies.\n",
      "He said he was a friend of Heywood Broun who had run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression, but the generous Broun to whom I wrote did not know his name and I somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling round the house.\n",
      "But one day came the voice of a man I had known when he was a boy, and I later remembered that this boy, thirty years before, had struck me as coming to no good.\n",
      "There had been something sinister about him that warned me against him, -- I had never felt that way about any other boy, -- but when he uttered his name on the telephone I had forgotten this and I was glad to do what he asked of me.\n",
      "He was a captain, he said, in the army, and on the train to New York his purse and all his money had been stolen, and would I lend him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the General Delivery window??\n",
      "We lived for a while in a movie melodrama with a German cook and her son who turned out to be Nazis.\n",
      "Finally we got them out of the house, after the boy had run away four times looking for other Nazis, threatening to murder village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next Fuhrer.\n",
      "Then he began to have epileptic fits.\n",
      "We found that a charitable society in New York had a long case-history of the two;;\n",
      "and they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody else's soup.\n"

      "His reading ranged from Agatha Christie to The Book Of Job and he had an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures, while his letters were full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom he had been intimately thrown six decades before.\n",
      "I could never forget the gaiety with which, when he was both blind and deaf, he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures;;\n",
      "and once when he came to see us in New York he walked away in a rainstorm, unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella, although he was at the time ninety years old.\n",
      "I never met John Dewey, whose style was a sort of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to Mexico with him when he was investigating the cause of Trotsky;;\n",
      "but I liked to think of him at ninety swimming and working at Key West long after Hemingway had moved to Cuba.\n",
      "I had to confess that I had missed these frescoes, recently discovered, that he had studied in his eighties.\n",
      "Sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy of Epicurus whom, with his followers, Dante put in hell;;\n",
      "Of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe the philosopher Whitehead said the Earth's first visitors to Mars should be persons likely to make a good impression, and when he was asked, `` Whom would you send''??\n",
      "This friend of many years came once to visit us in the house at Weston.\n",
      "Then I spoke at the ninetieth birthday party of W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, who embarked on a fictional trilogy at eighty-nine and who, with The Crisis, had created a Negro intelligentsia that had never existed in America before him.\n",
      "Mr. Burlingham, -- `` C.C.B.'' -- wrote to me once about an old friend of mine, S. K. Ratcliffe, whom I had first met in London in 1914 and who also came out for a week-end in Weston.\n",
      "His wife, Katie, `` as gay as a lark and as lively as a gazelle'', -- she was then seventy-six, -- had `` a sense of humour that has been denied S.K., but neither has any aesthetic perceptions.\n",
      "S.K. was visiting C.C.B. and, not waiting for breakfast, he was off to the University Club, where he spent hours writing obituaries of living Americans for The Manchester Guardian or The Glasgow Herald.\n",
      "Then, all but blind, he said there was nothing in Back to Methuselah --, -- `` G.B.S. ought to have known that'', -- and `` I look at my bookshelves despairingly, knowing that I can have nothing more to do with them''.\n",
      "Finally, colleges and clubs took the line that speakers from England were not wanted any longer, even speakers like S.K., so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the Americans for many years.\n",
      "While S.K. did not like Dylan Thomas, I liked his poems very much, but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so, whereupon he said to me, `` I suppose you think you know all about me''.\n",
      "But I only thought of that in the middle of the night.\n",
      "Many years later I went to see S.K. in England, where he was living at Whiteleaf, near Aylesbury, and he showed me beside his cottage there the remains of the road on which Boadicea is supposed to have travelled.\n",
      "He was convinced that George Orwell's 1984 was nearly all wrong as it applied to England, which was `` driving forward into uncharted waters'', with the danger of a new tyranny ahead.\n",
      "With facts mainly in his mind, he was often acute in the matter of style, and he said, `` The young who have as yet nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines.\n",
      "But put them before a situation which they are forced to depict'', -- he was speaking of the Spanish civil war, -- `` and they have no hesitation;;\n",
      "they merely do their best to make it real for others''.\n",
      "And that was the end.\n",
      "He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken.\n",
      "They would go to New York together, where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery.\n",
      "On New Year's Eve, Alfred Harcourt drove him up the Hudson to Bill Brown's Training Camp, a well-known establishment for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who could no longer help themselves.\n",
      "But, in departing, Lewis begged Breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the Grosvenor on his return, and he took with him the first thirty galleys of Elmer Gantry.\n",
      "On January 4, with the boys back at school and college, Mrs. Lewis wrote Harcourt to say that she was `` through, quite through''.\n",
      "Physically as well as mentally I have reached the limit of my endurance.\n",
      "My last gift to him is complete silence until the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down.\n",
      "For him to divorce God and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity.\n",
      "I am really ill at the present moment, and I will go to some sort of a sanitarium to normalize myself''.\n",
      "And she withdrew then to Cromwell Hall, in Cromwell, Connecticut.\n",
      "on January 8, 1927, he returned to the Grosvenor in high spirits, and looking fit.\n",
      "He had been, he wrote Mencken at once, `` in the country'', a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly changed him.\n",
      "Charles Breasted remembers that, before unpacking his bag, he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order, and almost at once `` the familiar procession of people began milling through our living room at any hour between two P.M. and three A.M.''.\n",
      "They were strays of every kind -- university students and journalists, Village hangers-on and barflies, taxi drivers and editors and unknown poets, as well as friends like Elinor Wylie and William Rose Benet, the Van Dorens and Nathan, Rebecca West and Hugh Walpole and Osbert Sitwell, Laurence Stallings, Lewis Browne, William Seabrook, Arthur Hopkins, the Woodwards.\n",
      "When he came home from his office at the end of the afternoon, Breasted never knew what gathering he should expect to find, but there almost always was one.\n",
      "He did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall, but telephoned her and wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish to `` stand behind'' her in their separation and of his hope that there would be no bitterness between them.\n",
      "She was occupying herself in an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they had rented abroad.\n",
      "He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad when the Gantry galleys were finished.\n",
      "For a time, urging Breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing instead, he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research for the labor novel;;\n",
      "When Breasted insisted that this was impossible for him, Lewis decided to go abroad.\n",
      "He telephoned L. M. Birkhead and asked him and his wife to come to Europe as his guests, but Birkhead declined on the grounds that one of them must be in the United States when Elmer Gantry was published.\n",
      "Lewis was spending his mornings, with the help of two secretaries, on the galleys of that long novel, making considerable revisions, and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity exhausted him once more, so that he was compelled to spend three days in the Harbor Sanatorium in the last week of January.\n",
      "Before he made that retreat, he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas City and asked him to come to Europe with him.\n",
      "Blackman was to be in New York by February 2, because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning.\n",
      "Lewis told him what clothes he should bring along, and enjoined him not to buy anything that he did not already own, they would do that in New York.\n",
      "Blackman arrived a day or two early, and Lewis took him to a department store immediately and outfitted him, luggage and all, and then he took him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until four in the morning.\n",
      "On the evening that they were to sail, Lewis himself gave a party, but he was too indisposed to appear at it.\n",
      "Woodward took occasion to warn Blackman about Lewis's drinking and urged him to `` try to keep him sober''.\n",
      "After a dinner party for which she had come down to New York, Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them off, and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to be about the real nature of their separation.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Mrs. Lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished, let him sleep with chambermaids if he must, but, she begged Blackman, try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in good health.\n",
      "As they stood at the first-class rail, waving down to his wife and Casanova below, Lewis said, `` Earl, there is Gracie's future husband''.\n",
      "He was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered fifty technical errors in its account of church practices.\n",
      "L. M. Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent.\n",
      "But his rancor did not cease, and presently, on March 13, when he preached a sermon on the text, `` And Ben-hadad Was Drunk'', he told his congregation how disappointed he was in Mr. Lewis, how he regretted having had him in his house, and how he should have been warned by the fact that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the book.\n",
      "But that sermon, like those of hundreds of other ministers, was yet to be delivered.\n",
      "To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life, about his wish to be a newspaperman once more, about the prevalence of American slang in British speech, about the loquacity of the English and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage, about his plans to wander for two years `` unless stopped and made to write another book''.\n",
      "The Manchester Guardian wondered how anyone in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to Mr. Lewis, since it was well known that Mr. Lewis always did all of the talking.\n",
      "His English friends, it said, had gone into training to keep up with him vocally and with his `` allegro movements around the luncheon table''.\n",
      "Lewis's remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce American reporters to invade the offices of Harcourt, Brace& Company for information, to pursue Mrs. Lewis to Cromwell Hall, and, after she had returned to New York, to ferret her out at the Stanhope on upper Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment.\n",
      "There, to the Evening Post, she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son, which henceforth would be strictly American.\n",
      "One had it that a friend, protesting her snobbery, said, `` But, Gracie, you are an American, aren't you''??\n",
      "He is said to have reported that once, when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation, and the friend protested that it had been `` nothing'', she replied, `` Well, it was your healthy American peasant blood that pulled you through''.\n",
      "At once upon his arrival, he telephoned Lady Sybil Colefax who invited them to tea, and then Lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding up his friends.\n",
      "It was a dinner party, Lewis had been drinking during the afternoon, and long before the party really got under way, he was quite drunk, with the result that the party broke up even before dinner was over.\n",
      "Lewis, at the head of the table, would leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks that, when not highly offensive, were at least highly inappropriate, and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed.\n",
      "When Blackman emerged from the bedroom, everyone was gone except the tolerant Lord Thomson, who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour, and then Blackman lay awake most of that night, despairing of what he must expect on the Continent.\n",
      "Blackman said that he wanted to apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making that horrible spectacle of himself, that he should have seized him by the neck at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom.\n",
      "Lewis warned him never to lay a hand on him, and then Blackman asked for his fare back to the United States.\n",
      "Lewis looked at him and began to cry, and then, saying that he was going to make a promise, he asked Blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want.\n",
      "`` And from now on, for the rest of this trip, I will only drink what you agree that I should drink''.\n",
      "Blackman called the porter and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy, and after that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner, or, on one of their walking trips, beer, or, in France and Italy, wine in moderation.\n",
      "Lewis gave him a guidebook tour of London and, motoring and walking, took him to Stratford, but the London stay was for only ten days, and on the twentieth they took the train for Southampton, where they spent the night for an early morning Channel crossing.\n",
      "He suggested that they call on these brothers, who received them pleasantly.\n",
      "Then they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed.\n",
      "It was late, and Blackman was ready to go to sleep, but Lewis was not.\n",
      "Earl agreed, and Lewis said that it would have been very different if his wife had been with him.\n",
      "He began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming, and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries.\n",
      "From 1613 on, if the lists exist, they contain between twenty to thirty names.\n",
      "As the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was, according to Masson( Life, 1:218) and n, two hundred fifty-nine, the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors who then incepted.\n",
      "The third name was( John) Ravencroft, who was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1631.\n",
      "Manningham also proceeded M.A. in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year.\n",
      "The fourteenth name was( Richard) Buckenham, written Buckman, admitted to Christ's College under Scott 2 July 1625.\n",
      "The fifteenth name was( Thomas) Baldwin, admitted to Christ's 4 March 1625 under Alsop.\n",
      "Christ's College was well represented that year in the ordo, and the name highest on the list from that college was Milton's, fourth in the entire university.\n",
      "Small wonder that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received there, since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher than that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year.\n",
      "It is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them.\n",
      "The process usually began with a tutor boasting about a boy, as Chappell had boasted about Lightfoot, to the higher officers of the college and university.\n",
      "It would, however, reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the public-school performances of the incepting bachelors, and the place that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was incepting.\n",
      "Milton's name being fourth is neither too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of vice-chancellor, proctor, master, or other mighty hand.\n",
      "Looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years of Milton's undergraduate days, certain phases of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us.\n",
      "It differed from what an undergraduate receives today from any American college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates.\n",
      "Milton was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of Latin grammar, logic-rhetoric, ethics, physics or natural philosophy, metaphysics, and Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.\n",
      "He had also sampled various special fields of learning, being unable to miss some study of divinity, Justinian( law), and Galen( medicine).\n",
      "Above all, he had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of artistry.\n",
      "He had learned to dispute devastatingly, both formally and informally in Latin, and according to the rules on any topic, pro or con, drawn from almost any subject, more especially from Aristotle's works.\n",
      "He had also learned to dispute extempore remarkably well, the main evidence for which of course is the presence of his name in the honors list of 1628/29.\n",
      "He also displayed the ability to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute, the verses, of course, to be delivered from memory.\n",
      "But his greatest achievement, in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues and teachers, was his amazing ability to produce literary Latin pieces, and he was often called on to do so.\n",
      "And his performances attracted much attention, as the frequency of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his undergraduate activities testifies.\n",
      "His later boastings of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and practice devoted to the use of that weapon.\n",
      "Milton himself, uncommunicative as he is about his lesser and nonliterary activities, at least gives us some evidence that he was a great walker, under any and all conditions.\n",
      "His early poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city and the neighboring country that may be extended to Cambridge and its surrounding countryside.\n",
      "The churches, the taverns, and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he roved to and about them.\n",
      "The tiny hamlet of Chesterton to the north, with the fens and marshes lying on down the Ouse River, may have attracted him often, as it did many other youths of the time.\n",
      "The Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded him and all other students a vantage point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling.\n",
      "The country about Cambridge is flat and not particularly spectacular in its scenery, though it offers easy going to the foot traveler.\n",
      "He smoked, as did everybody, and imbibed the various alcoholic beverages of that day, although his protestations while at Cambridge and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and, we must add, of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers.\n",
      "What manner of person does Milton appear to have been when as an undergraduate he resided at Christ's College??\n",
      "Graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight, wiry frame, he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college, to which he himself referred in Prolusion 6::\n",
      "That is, if we can trust that most specious of prolusions, packed as it is with wit and persiflage.\n",
      "but anyone who would put much trust in any phase of Prolusion 6, except its illusive allusiveness deserves whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously stilted banter.\n",
      "the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that almost nothing in it can be accepted as true -- or discarded as false.\n",
      "the mere fact that he was selected, though as a substitute, to act as interlocutor or moderator for it, or perhaps we should say with Buck as' father of the act', is in itself a difficult phase of his development to grasp.\n",
      "Milton was to act as the archfool, the supreme wit, the lightly bantering pater, Pater Liber, who could at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment, or could at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering, and with words alone.\n",
      "It may be thought unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform, if again we may trust the opening of the oratio, for it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play that even in this Latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an adversary.\n",
      "But the real beginnings of this development in him go back to the opposing of grammar school, and probably if it had not been this occasion and these Latin lines it would have been some others, such as the first prolusion, that set off this streak in him of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy.\n",
      "All western Europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century.\n",
      "But these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's College days are only one phase of his existence then.\n",
      "Perhaps his most important private activity was the combination of reading, discussion with a few -- if we can trust his writings to Diodati and the younger Gill, very few -- congenial companions.\n",
      "Lines 23-36 of Lycidas later point to a friendship with Edward King, who entered Christ's College 9 June 1626.\n",
      "No other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted.\n",
      "But that scarcely means that he was the aloof, forbidding type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows, the banter of the surviving prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this.\n",
      "but even in that famous passage, Milton was aiming not at the theatricals as such but at their performance by' persons either enter'd, or presently to enter into the ministry.\n",
      "The fact that he nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of the boys later in his hypothetical academy( 1644) should not be taken too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances.\n",
      "Perhaps, in that short piece or letter written to Hartlib in which he sketched his scheme for educating young men, he merely overlooked that phase of their exercises.\n",
      "Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot.\n",
      "On the other hand, the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies -- science fiction, of course, is related, if sometimes distantly, to that utopian literature optimistic about science, literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia.\n",
      "Childhood's End -- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz's Utopian romance, Auf Zwei Planeten( 1897), and also to Wells's Histories Of The Future, especially, The World Set Free( 1914) and The Shape Of Things To Come( 1933) -- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords, vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development, an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe.\n",
      "Arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland, the Overlords unite earth into one world in which justice, order, and benevolence prevail and ignorance, poverty, and fear have ceased to exist.\n",
      "Both abolition of war and new techniques of production, particularly robot factories, greatly increase the world's wealth, a situation described in the following passage, which has the true utopian ring: `` Everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free, provided as a public service by the community, as roads, water, street lighting and drainage had once been.\n",
      "With destructive tensions and pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human life -- rebuilding entire cities, expanding facilities for entertainment, providing unlimited opportunities for education -- indeed, for the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the fullest.\n",
      "Considering then the optimism which has permeated science fiction for so long, what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future, have attacked the Childhood's End kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition.\n",
      "Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s, A Canticle For Leibowitz( 1959) finds men, after the great atomic disaster, stumbling back to their previous level of civilization and another catastrophe;;\n",
      "Frederick Pohl's `` The Midas Touch''( 1954) predicts an economy of abundance which, in order to remain prosperous, must set its robots to consuming surplus production;;\n",
      "Clifford D. Simak's `` How-2''( 1954) tells of a future when robots have taken over, leaving men nothing to do;;\n",
      "A more complete list would also include Bradbury's `` The Pedestrian''( 1951), Philip K. Dick's Solar Lottery( 1955), David Karp's One( 1953), Wilson Tucker's The Long Loud Silence( 1952), Jack Vance's To Live Forever( 1956), Gore Vidal's Messiah( 1954), and Bernard Wolfe's Limbo( 1952), as well as the three perhaps most outstanding dystopias, Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants( 1953), Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano( 1952), and John Wyndham's Re-Birth( 1953), works which we will later examine in detail.\n",
      "There is, of course, nothing new about dystopias, for they belong to a literary tradition which, including also the closely related satiric utopias, stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and Swift's Gulliver's Travels to the twentieth century and Zamiatin's We, Capek's War With The Newts, Huxley's Brave New World, E. M. Forster's `` The Machine Stops'', C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength, and Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and which in science fiction is represented before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy, The Time Machine, `` A Story Of The Days To Come'', and When The Sleeper Wakes, and as recently as Jack Williamson's `` With Folded Hands''( 1947), the classic story of men replaced by their own robots.\n",
      "What makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life.\n",
      "Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the last twelve years, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four, an assumption which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as Room 101, along with education by conditioning from Brave New World, a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia.\n",
      "Not all recent science fiction, however, is dystopian, for the optimistic strain is still very much alive in Mission Of Gravity and Childhood's End, as we have seen, as well as in many other recent popular novels and stories like Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud( 1957);;\n",
      "In addition, there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined, for science-fiction dystopias often extrapolate political, social, economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology.\n",
      "Nevertheless, with all these qualifications and exceptions, the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology, instead of bringing utopia, may well enslave, dehumanize, and even destroy men.\n",
      "Easily the best known of these three novels is The Space Merchants, a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact of science on human life, though its most important warning is in this area, namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put.\n",
      "Like ours, the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive, and, like ours, it is based on the principle of `` ever increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption''.\n",
      "The consequences, of course, have been dreadful: reckless expansion has led to overpopulation, pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural resources.\n",
      "For example, even the most successful executive lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night;;\n",
      "soyaburgers have replaced meat, and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive jewelry;;\n",
      "and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs.\n",
      "What is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an `` outrage, an assault on people's mental privacy'' or that it is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains a coercive tendency( which is closer to the point).\n",
      "Pohl and Kornbluth's ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with `` every basic trauma and neurosis in American life'', which work on the libido of consumers, which are linked to the `` great prime motivations of the human spirit''.\n",
      "As the hero, Mitchell Courtenay, explains before his conversion, the job of advertising is `` to convince people without letting them know that they're being convinced''.\n",
      "And to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research, who, for example, tell Courtenay that three days is the `` optimum priming period for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase'' -- which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine it.\n",
      "And the second requirement for convincing people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered.\n",
      "Thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet, the person `` capable of putting together words that stir and move and sing''.\n",
      "Now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what motivates the manipulators, that is, what are their values??\n",
      "Indeed, again and again, the space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners and behavioral scientists, once they have seen through human nature, will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them.\n",
      "We often say of a person that he `` looks young for his age'' or `` old for his age''.\n",
      "And this means, I suppose, that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind.\n",
      "Its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious than the body does.\n",
      "age may be idealistic, believing and much given to professions of optimism.\n",
      "The pessimism of the young is defiant, anxious to confess or even exaggerate its ostensible gloom, and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that it regards its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate for the awfulness of that truth.\n",
      "If it proclaims that the best is yet to be, it always arouses, at least in the young, either a suspicious question or perhaps the exclamation of the Negro youth who saw on a tombstone the inscription, `` I am not dead but sleeping''.\n",
      "We may say of some unfortunates that they were never young.\n",
      "We cannot truthfully say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old.\n",
      "No good can come of contemplating the sad, inevitable fact that once youth has passed `` a worse and worse time still succeeds the former''.\n",
      "One is that there sometimes are real although inadequate compensations in growing old.\n",
      "Serenity, if one is fortunate enough to achieve it, is not so good as joy, but it is something.\n",
      "Even to be `` from hope and fear set free'' is at least better than to have lost the first without having got rid of the second.\n",
      "The other reason( and the one with which I am here concerned) is that one thus becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion, or change of opinion, whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all too obvious physical differences.\n",
      "One may be exasperatingly aware that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of one's own age.\n",
      "Many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately, even if they have never actually been told, what my age is.\n",
      "At least I should like them to know that I know these discounts are being made.\n",
      "I have known some men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember seem utter strangers to them now;;\n",
      "that their remote past is as discontinuous with their present selves, as lacking in any conscious likeness to their mature personality, as the self of a butterfly may be imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was.\n",
      "For my part I find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs.\n",
      "but I am so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that I see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello and Proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains unchanged.\n",
      "So far as I am concerned, the child is unmistakably father to the man, despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly -- sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.\n",
      "That fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in their youth and are now so extremely conservative( or reactionary, as many would say) that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make the distinction between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Khrushchev for them hardly worth noting.\n",
      "But in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were: passionate, sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of, capable of seeing black and white only and, therefore, committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to.\n",
      "To those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally, or politically, or sociologically antiquated( and I have reason to know that there are some such), I would like to say what I have already hinted, namely, that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that I am no longer young and therefore incapable of being youthful of mind.\n",
      "But I will also remind them that I have always been inclined to skepticism, to a kind of Laodicean lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned;;\n",
      "so that, although not as eager as I once was to be disapproved of, I can still resist prevailing opinions.\n",

      "The favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop.\n",
      "There was, it seems to me, enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of Russian leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out.\n",

      "For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species Man, or, as Malraux himself puts it, `` to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves''.\n",
      "The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange;;\n",
      "If we are to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux's latest book, La Metamorphose Des Dieux, Vol. 1(( 1957), he is still engaged in writing a large novel under his original title.\n",
      "But as he remarks in his preface to The Walnut Trees, `` a novel can hardly ever be rewritten'', and `` when this one appears in its final form, the form of the first part will no doubt be radically changed''.\n",
      "Malraux pretends, perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty, that his fragmentary work will accordingly `` appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophiles'' and `` to connoisseurs of what might have been''.\n",
      "The theme of The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg is most closely related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux's array of novels: Man's Hope( 1937).\n",
      "This magnificent but greatly underestimated book, which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation, has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event -- the Spanish Civil War -- that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political feuds.\n",
      "Even so apparently impartial a critic as W. H. Frohock has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of Loyalist propaganda;;\n",
      "and has then gone on to argue, with unimpeachable consistency, that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects of the book are simply inadvertent `` contradictions''.\n",
      "The whole purpose of Man's Hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence -- and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty, justice and human dignity.\n",
      "`` and the more the action claims to be total, the smaller is the part of man engaged''.\n",
      "These lines never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltations of combat, and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal necessities of war.\n",
      "It is this larger theme of the `` quality of man'', a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into `` the human'', which now forms the pulsating heart of Malraux's artistic universe.\n",
      "Malraux, to be sure, does not abandon the world of violence, combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative artist, and which is the only world, apparently, in which his imagination can flame into life.\n",
      "But while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that Malraux wishes to express, these values are no longer linked with the triumph or defeat of any cause -- whether that of an individual assertion of the will-to-power, or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation of oppression -- as their necessary condition.\n",
      "This central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first World War.\n",
      "The narrator is an Alsatian serving with the French Army, and he has the same name( Berger) that Malraux himself was later to use in the Resistance;;\n",
      "like Malraux he was also serving in the tank corps before being captured, and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been a writer.\n",
      "Much more important is to grasp the feelings of the narrator( whose full name is never given) as he becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of French prisoners clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral of Chartres.\n",
      "For as his companions gradually dissolve back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity, as they lose all the appanage of their acquired culture, he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind.\n",
      "Here I am face to face with the primeval stuff''.\n",
      "and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done.\n",
      "A good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families -- even when it becomes clear that the Germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind.\n",
      "Awkwardly and laboriously, in stiff, unemotional phrases, the soldiers continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love;;\n",
      "they instinctively struggle to keep open a road to the future in their hearts.\n",
      "And by a skillful and unobtrusive use of imagery( the enclosure is called a `` Roman-camp stockade'', the hastily erected lean-to is a `` Babylonian hovel'', the men begin to look like `` Peruvian mummies'' and to acquire `` Gothic faces''), Malraux projects a fresco of human endurance -- which is also the endurance of the human -- stretching backward into the dark abyss of time.\n",
      "The narrator feels himself catching a glimpse of pre-history, learning of man's `` age-old familiarity with misfortune'', as well as his `` equally age-old ingenuity, his secret faith in endurance, however crammed with catastrophes, the same faith perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine''.\n",
      "This new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied by a re-vision of his previous view.\n",
      "Is this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with the ideological??\n",
      "But now he knows `` that an intellectual is not only a man to whom books are necessary, he is any man whose reasoning, however elementary it may be, affects and directs his life''.\n",
      "The men around him, observes the narrator, `` have been living from day to day for thousands of years''.\n",
      "and the narrator recalls the words of his father, Vincent Berger: `` It is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one finally comes down to mankind''.\n",
      "`` He was not much older than myself,'' writes the narrator, `` when he began to feel the impact of that human mystery which now obsesses me, and which makes me begin, perhaps, to understand him''.\n",
      "but he quickly involves himself in the Young Turk revolutionary movement to such an extent that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism.\n",
      "And, after becoming the right-hand man of Enver Pasha, he is sent by the latter to pave the way for a new Turkish Empire embracing `` the union of all Turks throughout Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases on the Silk Trade Route''.\n",
      "and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing human any longer seemed to survive, Vincent Berger begins to dream of the Occident.\n",
      "'' Finally, after almost being beaten to death by a madman -- he could not fight back because madmen are sacred to Islam -- he throws up his mission and returns to Europe.\n",
      "Despite Berger's report, Enver Pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a Turkish Blood Alliance;;\n",
      "and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men.\n",
      "`` For six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing,'' writes the narrator, `` not to understand that man begins with' the other'''.\n",
      "And when Vincent Berger returns to Europe, this first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation.\n",
      "Citing the experience of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War 2,, Eden said that all would have been confusion and disarray without them.\n",
      "Citing the advances of Communist power in recent years, Sir Anthony observed: `` This very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources to meet it''.\n",
      "While I fully agree with Sir Anthony's contention, I think that we must carry the analysis farther, bearing in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our need, the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the measure of our capacity.\n",
      "While it is hazardous to project the trend of history, it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully emerging in the Western world, particularly among the countries of Western Europe.\n",
      "The excesses of nationalism had brought down upon Europe a generation of tyranny and war, and a return to the old order of things seemed unthinkable.\n",
      "Under these conditions a new generation of Europeans began to discover the bonds of long association and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist xenophobia.\n",
      "A slow and painful trend toward unification has taken hold, a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which may also lead to a binding federation of Europe.\n",
      "It may well be that the unification of Europe will prove inadequate, that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of the entire Western world.\n",
      "The movement toward European unity has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism, one looking to the constitution of a United States of Europe, the other building on wartime precedents of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problems.\n",
      "Many factors contributed to the growth of the European movement.\n",
      "Had Churchill been returned to office in 1945, it is just possible that Britain, instead of standing fearfully aloof, would have led Europe toward union.\n",
      "In 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coordinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to supervise and coordinate the uses of American aid under the Marshall Plan.\n",
      "The United States might well have exploited the opportunity provided by the European Recovery Program to push the hesitant European nations toward political federation as well as economic cooperation, but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the United States Government at the time.\n",
      "For a time it appeared that a common European army might be created, but the project for a European Defense Community was rejected by the French National Assembly in 1954.\n",
      "In 1957 the social-economic approach to European integration was capped by the formation among `` the Six'' of a tariff-free European Common Market, and Euratom for cooperation in the development of atomic energy.\n",
      "The United States and Canada belong only to NATO and the new O.E.C.D..\n",
      "Now Britain has decided to seek admission to the European Economic Community and it seems certain that she will be joined by some of her partners in the loose Free Trade Area of the `` Outer Seven''.\n",
      "If a broader Atlantic community is to be formed -- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both our needs and our capacity -- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand in the NATO alliance.\n",
      "They will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any and all of them''.\n",
      "It cannot become the source of a real Atlantic community if it remains organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought it into being''.\n",
      "The problem of NATO is not one of machinery, of which there is an abundance, but of the will to use it.\n",
      "This machinery will not become the instrument of an Atlantic community by fiat, but only when that community evolves from potentiality to reality.\n",
      "The existence of a community is a state of mind -- a conviction that goals and values are widely shared, that effective communication is possible, that mutual trust is reasonably assured.\n",
      "Indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than NATO for the development of a parliamentary organ of the Atlantic nations, because it could encompass all of the members of the Atlantic community including those, like Sweden and Switzerland, who are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like Aj.\n",
      "Underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a conviction that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed form a community, at least a potential community.\n",
      "what is new and compelling is that the West is now but one of several powerful civilizations, or `` systems'', and that one or more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the West.\n",
      "That time is now past and the Atlantic nations, if they are to survive, must develop a full-fledged community, and they must also look beyond the frontiers of `` Western civilization'' toward a world-wide `` concert of free nations''.\n",
      "The burden of these reflections is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs.\n",
      "And if we do not aspire to too much, it is also within our capacity.\n",
      "A realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand, and our capacity to achieve them on the other, must be approached through the concept of `` community''.\n",
      "History has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger ceases to be dramatically urgent.\n",
      "Only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy.\n",
      "It follows that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation and coordination.\n",
      "It is for these reasons that proposals for a `` new world order'', through radical overhaul of the United Nations or through some sort of world federation, are utterly fatuous.\n",
      "I believe that these proposals, however meritorious in terms of world needs, go far beyond our capacity to realize them.\n",
      "Such proposals look to an apocalyptic act, a kind of Lockian `` social contract'' on a world-wide scale.\n",
      "The defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible.\n",
      "The failures of the U.N. and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond what was internationally feasible.\n",
      "Our problem, therefore, is to devise processes more modest in their aspirations, adjusted to the real world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities.\n",
      "The history of the U.N. demonstrates that in a pluralistic world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than coercion.\n",
      "It is possible that international organization will ultimately supplant the multi-state system, but its proper function for the immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world.\n",
      "The trouble with this machinery is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nations.\n",
      "the history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations demonstrates that.\n",
      "A realistic `` concert of free nations'' might be expected to consist of an `` inner community'' of the North Atlantic nations and an `` outer community'' embracing much or all of the non-Communist world.\n",
      "`` It might well start a craze like swallowing goldfish or pee-wee golf'', wrote Kenneth Rexroth in an explanatory note in the Evergreen Review, and he may have been right.\n",
      "Lawrence Ferlenghetti and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz, and the vocabulary of the musician.\n",
      "Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry.\n",
      "( Judy Tristano now has poems as well as ballads written for her.\n",
      "Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff, a name-dropper of jazz heroes, and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz.\n",
      "In San Francisco he has worked with Brew Moore, Charlie Mingus, and other `` swinging'' musicians of secure reputation, thus placing himself within established jazz traditions, in addition to being a part of the San Francisco `` School''.\n",
      "Although Patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz, the musical group that he works with, the Chamber Jazz Sextet, is often ignored by jazz critics.\n",
      "Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles, and Patchen himself has remained outside the San Francisco poetry group, maintaining a self-imposed isolation, even though his conversion to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear.\n",
      "From the beginning of his career, Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry.\n",
      "His first book, Before The Brave( 1936), is a collection of poems that are almost all Communistic, but after publication of this book he rejected Communism, and advocated a pacifistic anarchy, though retaining his revolutionary idiom.\n",
      "He spoke for a `` proletariat'' that included `` all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth''.\n",
      "Patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people.\n",
      "Running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate in man, the capacity for love and brotherhood, the ability to appreciate beauty.\n",
      "Beauty as well as love is redemptive, and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation.\n",
      "The Dark Kingdom sends Angels of Death and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness.\n",
      "These early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to Patchen.\n",
      "Beginning in Cloth Of The Tempest( 1943) he experimented in merging poetry and visual art, using drawings to carry long narrative segments of a story, as in Sleepers Awake, and constructing elaborate `` poems-in-drawing-and-type'' in which it is impossible to distinguish between the `` art'' and the poetry.\n",
      "Many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political;;\n",
      "so during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946, Patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference, and the `` private eye'' as a myth hero.\n",
      "Speaking in terms of sociological stereotype, the `` private eye'' might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons.\n",
      "He is usually something of an underdog, he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized criminals.\n",
      "most important to Patchen, he was a non-literary hero, and very contemporary.\n",
      "He has, like so many other secular and religious culture symbols, gone over to the side of the ruling classes.\n",
      "It was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician.\n",
      "The revolution in jazz that took place around 1949, the evolution from the `` bebop'' school of Dizzy Gillespie to the `` cool'' sound of Miles Davis and Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz, and the whole legend of Charlie Parker, had made an impression on many academic and literary men.\n",
      "The differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools of jazz, the differences between the `` hard bop'' school of Rollins, and the `` cerebral'' experiments of Tristano, Konitz and Marsh, the general differences in the mores of white and Negro musicians, all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public.\n",
      "The immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him, and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry, as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry.\n",
      "In addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz, Patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago.\n",
      "In this respect, his approach to poetry-and-jazz is in marked contrast to Kenneth Rexroth's.\n",
      "Rexroth uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz, including many of his Chinese and Japanese translations;;\n",
      "Rexroth may sometimes achieve an effective juxtaposition, but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz `` feeling'' in the text of his poems, relying on his very competent musicians to supply this feeling.\n",
      "Patchen does read some of his earlier works to music, but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz.\n",
      "These new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians, but they show changes in Patchen's approach to his poetry, for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician.\n",
      "It is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician.\n",
      "Everyone knows that private detectives in real life are not like Sam Spade and Pat Novak, but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked.\n",
      "He is forced to play for little money, and must often take another job to live.\n",
      "His approach to music is highly individualistic;;\n",
      "Many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective, but where the detective is active and militant, the jazz musician is passive, almost a victim of society.\n",
      "In order to write with authority either about musicians, or as a musician, Patchen would have to soft pedal his characteristically outspoken anger, and change( at least for the purposes of this poetry) from a revolutionary to a victim.\n",
      "He has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest symbols and devices to the new work, and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry.\n",
      "Perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that Patchen's new poetry is well thought out, and remains within the mainstream of his work, while being suited to a new form.\n",
      "Angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills;;\n",
      "Angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty.\n",
      "Angry because I was that very one somebody was supposed To be fighting for''.\n",
      "This angry and exasperated stance which Patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval of the modern world.\n",
      "Although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues to be sung, the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling.\n",
      "`` I went to the city And there I did Weep, Men a-crowing like asses, And living like sheep.\n",
      "Yes, I went to the city, And there I did bitterly cry, Men out of touch with the earth, And with never a glance at the sky.\n",
      "each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development.\n",

      "Krim's typicality consists only in his New Yorker's view that New York is the world;;\n",
      "he displays what outlanders call the New York mind, a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself.\n",
      "Closely related to his illusions about his typicality is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness.\n"

      "the combination of the Jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and incredible intellectual-literary ambition I have ever seen or could ever have imagined.\n",
      "their reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal blushes about appearing' Jewish' in subway, bus, racetrack, movie house, any of the public places that used to make the Jew of my generation self-conscious( heavy thinkers walking across Seventh Avenue without their glasses on, willing to dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature of the Yiddish intellectual).\n",
      "'' At other points in his narrative, Krim associates Jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition, with abstraction, with his personal turning aside from the good, the true, and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of James T. Farrell to the international, the false, and the inflated.\n",
      "Krim says, in short, that he is a suffering Jew.\n",
      "The only possible answer to that is, I am a suffering Franco-Irishman.\n",
      "We all love to suffer, but some of us love to suffer more than others.\n",
      "Had Krim gone farther from New York than Chapel Hill, he might have discovered that large numbers of American Jews do not find his New York version of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable.\n",
      "More important is the simple human point that all men suffer, and that it is a kind of anthropological-religious pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering is more poignant than mine or anyone else's.\n",
      "This is not to deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos, but only to assert that these horrors have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience them, that among the various side effects is the local hysteria of Jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion, which they call oppression and pain.\n",
      "In their stupidity and arrogance they believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms and ghettos.\n",
      "Finally, there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest American fiction is being written by Jews, but it is not Jewish fiction;;\n",
      "Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud, through intellectual toughness, perception, through experience in fact, have obviously liberated themselves from any sentimental Krim self-indulgence they might have been tempted to.\n",
      "Krim was able to get an advance for a novel, and time and opportunity to write at Yaddo, but it was no good.\n",
      "`` I had natural sock'', he says,' as a storyteller and was precociously good at description, dialogue, and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade but I was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained fiction-writing''.\n",
      "Krim came to believe that `` the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning''.\n",
      "His `` articulate Jewish friends'' convinced him that education( read `` reading'') was `` a must''.\n",
      "Then followed a period in which he wrote reviews for The New York Times Book Review, The Commonweal, Commentary, had a small piece in Partisan Review, and moved on to Hudson, The Village Voice, and Exodus.\n",
      "It was `` the creation of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in Spenglerian inclusiveness.\n",
      "their example caused Krim and his friends to put on `` Englishy airs, affect all sorts of impressive scholarship and social-register unnaturalness in order to slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages''.\n",
      "Qui s'excuse s'accuse, as the French Jewish intellectuals used to say.\n",
      "Through all this raving, Krim is performing a traditional and by now boring rite, the attack on intelligence, upon the largely successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate American writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn.\n",
      "God knows that Partisan and the rest often were, and remain, guilty of intellectual flatulence.\n",
      "Sociological jargon, Germano-Slavic approximations to English, third-rate but modish fiction, and outrages to common sense have often disfigured Partisan, and in lesser degree, the other magazines on the list.\n",
      "What Krim ignores, in his contempt for history and for accuracy, is that these magazines, Partisan foremost, brought about a genuine revolution in the American mind from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950.\n",
      "The process of cosmopolitanism had begun in earnest about 1912, but the First War and the depression virtually stalled that process in its tracks.\n",
      "Without the good magazines, without their book reviews, their hospitality to European writers, without above all their awareness of literary standards, we might very well have had a generation of Krim's heroes -- Wolfes, Farrells, Dreisers, and I might add, Sandburgs and Frosts and MacLeishes in verse -- and then where would we be??\n",
      "Politics, economics, sociology -- the entire area of life that lies `` between'' -- literature and what Krim calls experience -- urgently needed to be dug into.\n",
      "if it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would still be historic.\n",
      "Partisan Review and the other literary magazines helped to educate, in the best sense, an entire generation.\n",
      "It is a fact of life that magazines are edited by groups: they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all.\n",
      "And it is also a fact of life that there will always( be youngish half-educated people around, who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like a literary movement.\n",
      "He indicates that he has none of the, disciplines that criticism requires, including education;;\n",
      "No one was ever educated through bull-sessions in anything other than, to quote him again, `` perfumed bullshit.\n",
      "Only'' a New York hick would expect to find the literary life in Greenwich Village, at any point, later than Walt Whitman's day.\n",
      "The highly intellectual minds that Krim says he encountered, in the Village did their work in spite of,, not because of, any Village atmosphere.\n",
      "For the sad truth is that while one might write well without having read Bartleby The Scrivener, one is more likely, to write well if one has `` read it, and much else.\n",
      "He mentions the beats only once'', when he refers to their having revived through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to, commit death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual experience,, but the entire narrative, is written in the tiresome vocabulary `` of'' that lost `` and'' dying cause, `` and in the'' `` sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant, our mother, tongue.\n",
      "Ideas are the thruway to nowhere.\n",
      "My `` touchstones, had, been strictly'' literature and, humanly enough, American literature( because that was what I wanted to write).\n",
      "He alludes to something called direct writing, and he finds that criticism gets in the way of his truer, realer, imaginative bounce.\n",
      "At least they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated, flat, dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini's home district -- Dogumenti, per favore.\n",
      "But, who knew, that might be coming one of these days.\n",
      "They laughed and, true to national form and manners, never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all, but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts.\n",
      "Berto's The Sky Is Red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book to come out of the war.\n",
      "Now he was married to a beautiful girl, had a small son, and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies.\n",
      "On his bookshelves were some of the latest American novels, including Bellow's Seize The Day, but he hadn't read them( they were sent by American publishers) and wasn't especially interested in what the American writers were up to.\n",
      "He was thinking his way into a new novel, a big one, one that people had been waiting for.\n",
      "It was going to be hard going all the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while, except for a few stories, was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully used in The Sky Is Red.\n",
      "This one was going to be different.\n",
      "He had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of Calabria that he knew so well.\n",
      "He was going to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all, leave Rome and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life, go back to Calabria.\n",
      "He knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in The War In A Black Shirt, a wonderful book not, for some strange reason, published in the U.S..\n",
      "He knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor, southern, peasant boy.\n",
      "He had put it down in a war novel, The Day Of The Lion.\n",
      "The English lady said she had to go to Vienna for a while.\n",
      "It was a pity because she had planned to lay a wreath at the foot of the Garibaldi statue, towering over Rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the Gianicolo.\n",
      "Around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city, in that park are the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men, the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and, under fire all the way, up the long, straight narrow lane to take, then lose the high ground of the Villa Doria Pamphili.\n",
      "When they lost it, the French artillery moved in, and that was the end for Garibaldi that time, on 30 April 1849.\n",
      "We were at a party once and heard an idealistic young European call that awful charge glorious.\n",
      "He said it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that, no matter who gave the order and what for.\n",
      "`` We would see it that way, but it was glorious then.\n",
      "It was the last time in history anybody could do something gloriously like that''.\n",
      "The whole thing, from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks, spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jumped off, took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes.\n",
      "The sculptor looked at him, let the color drain out of his face, grinned, and looked down into his drink, a bad Martini made with raw Italian gin.\n",
      "The apartment where we were talking that afternoon in March faced onto the street Garibaldi's men had charged up and along.\n",
      "Across the way from the apartment building is a ruined house, shot to hell that day in 1849, and left that way as a memorial.\n",
      "Like everything else in Rome, ruins and monuments alike, that house is lived in.\n",
      "The English lady really wanted to put a wreath on the Garibaldi monument on the 30th of April.\n",
      "For one thing, there wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year.\n",
      "There were a few reasons for that, too: Garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the Communists nowadays.\n",
      "( It is sort of as if our government should decide to disown Washington or Lincoln for the same reason.\n",
      "Nothing was going to be done this year to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of Rome.\n",
      "All that the English lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath at its base.\n",
      "This would show that somebody, even a foreigner living in Rome, cared.\n",
      "It is hard for me to know how I feel about Lauro Di Bosis.\n",
      "He is thought either to have been killed by the Fascists as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing his plane.\n",
      "He really didn't know how to fly.\n",
      "Gossip had it( for gossip is the soul of Rome) that a famous American dancer of the time had paid for both the planes.\n",
      "Faced with a gesture like Di Bosis', I find usually that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend.\n",
      "The things that happened in police station basements were dirty, grubby, and most often anonymous.\n",
      "That is how the real routine of resistance goes on, and its strength is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be taken to pieces, piece by piece, without quitting.\n",
      "She had been picked up by the Russians, questioned in connection with some pamphlets, sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage.\n",
      "She showed us what had happened to her.\n",
      "Just no spot, not even a dimesize spot, on her whole body that wasn't bruised, bruise on top of bruise, from beatings.\n",
      "I understand very well about Lauro Di Bosis and how his action is symbolic.\n",
      "The trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one.\n",
      "The English lady wanted to pay tribute to Garibaldi and to Lauro Di Bosis, but she wasn't going to be here to do it.\n",
      "Were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her, by proxy so to speak??\n",
      "There was a pretty thorough silence at that point.\n",
      "I hate embarrassing silences and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one.\n",
      "Though Garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to Pickett's Charge -- which, like all Southerners, I view in almost Miltonic terms, fallen angels, etc. -- I associated the two.\n",
      "And to top it all I am often sentimental on purpose, trying to prove to myself that I am not afraid of sentiment.\n",
      "So much for all that.\n",
      "She gave me the names of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even march up to the monument with me.\n",
      "Such measures are essential to its job of presenting business and Government with the facts required to meet the objective of expanding business and improving the operation of the economy.\n",
      "Economic information is made available to businessmen and economists promptly through the monthly Survey Of Current Business and its weekly supplement.\n",
      "Technical assistance to small business community\n",
      "The Small Business Administration( SBA) provides guidance and advice on sources of technical information relating to small business management and research and development of products.\n",
      "They are written by specialists in numerous types of business enterprises, cover a wide range of subjects, and are directed to the needs and interests of the small firm.\n",
      "SBA offers Administrative Management Courses, which are designed to improve the management efficiency and `` know-how'' of small business concerns within a community.\n",
      "Through the SBA's Management Counseling Program, practical, personalized advice on sound management principles is available upon request to both prospective and established businessmen in a community.\n",
      "Production specialists in SBA regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems.\n",
      "Production specialists are available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems.\n",
      "These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the contract.\n",
      "The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal Government.\n",
      "Under this program, property sales specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources, including timber from the national forests.\n",
      "SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing.\n",
      "Proposed property sales of general interest to small business concerns are publicized through SBA regional news releases, and by `` flyers'' directed to the small business concerns.\n",
      "When suitable equipment is located by the SBA representative, the small business concern is contacted and advised on when, where, and how to bid on such property.\n",
      "Section 8-b-2 of the Small Business Act, as amended, authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business concerns.\n",
      "The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered.\n",
      "Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA's facilities register so that the small business concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration.\n",
      "These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants' field of operations.\n",
      "to small business\n",
      "SBA makes loans to individual small business firms, providing them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private lending sources on reasonable terms.\n",
      "Many such loans have been made to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth, thereby contributing substantially to community development programs.\n",
      "SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers, small business pools, wholesalers, retailers, service establishments and other small businesses( when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms), are to finance business construction, conversion, or expansion;;\n",
      "or to supply working capital.\n",
      "Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided.\n",
      "The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that, with loan assistance from the SBA, it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis.\n",
      "A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment.\n",
      "The record of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income.\n",
      "The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose of the loan.\n",
      "The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is $350,000.\n",
      "This system provides long- and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing, purchasing, and business service organizations.\n",
      "As a source of investment capital, the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural areas.\n",
      "The Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers' cooperatives.\n",
      "Three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives: Commodity loans, operating capital loans, and facility loans.\n",
      "To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives, a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing farm business services, and must meet the requirements set forth in the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended.\n",
      "To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals, the Office of Minerals Exploration( OME) of the U.S. Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the OME regulations.\n",
      "This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms.\n",
      "Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored.\n",
      "The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses.\n",
      "If nothing is produced, there is no obligation to repay.\n",
      "if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property, the royalty obligation continues for the 10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government's contribution is repaid with interest.\n",
      "The royalty applies to both principal and interest, but it never exceeds 5 percent.\n",
      "Others have so-called development plans, but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them.\n",
      "Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation.\n",
      "Nevertheless, we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.\n",
      "Third, we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources.\n",
      "designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation;;\n",
      "It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions.\n",
      "To insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth.\n",
      "In the more primitive areas, where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited, some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available.\n",
      "In such a case, however, we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task, supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task, and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress being made.\n",
      "At the other end of the spectrum, where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program, we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support, in cooperation with other developed countries, of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program.\n",
      "A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help.\n",
      "It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them, since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves.\n",
      "External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help.\n",
      "U.S. aid, therefore, should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take.\n",
      "In establishing conditions of self-help, it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image.\n",
      "Open societies can take many forms, and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals.\n",
      "On the other hand, it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist, such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them, or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them.\n",
      "Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential, we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur.\n",
      "This includes not only development programing, but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment;;\n",
      "fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation;;\n",
      "and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few.\n",
      "This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises, with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports.\n",
      "It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed.\n",
      "For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country.\n",
      "Otherwise, development will not lead to longrun stability.\n",
      "In many societies, what we regard as corruption, favoritism, and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly.\n",
      "Moreover, tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest.\n",
      "Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption.\n",
      "The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis, tailored to priority needs, to those countries making serious efforts in self-help.\n",
      "In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts.\n",
      "There are other countries where, with skillful diplomacy, we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth.\n",
      "But there will be still other countries where, despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help, we shall deem it wise, for political or military reasons, to give substantial economic assistance.\n",
      "Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination.\n",
      "The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention, our resources, and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries.\n",
      "To have any success in this effort, we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years, and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion.\n",
      "Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency\n",
      "How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country.\n",
      "Gradually others will move up to the same level\n",
      "Meantime, over the decade of the sixties, we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth.\n",
      "In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity, the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible.\n",
      "The whole program must be conceived of as an effort, stretching over a considerable number of years, to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world.\n",
      "It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba.\n",
      "( A) the need to budget a period of years.\n",
      "Dams, river development schemes, transportation networks, educational systems require years to construct.\n",
      "Thus, as a development program is being launched, commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year.\n",
      "( B) the need to plan investment programs.\n",
      "More importantly, several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence.\n",
      "Without such forward planning, investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them;;\n",
      "( C) the need to allocate country resources.\n",
      "Most important of all, the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources.\n",
      "They must be induced to establish the necessary tax, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies.\n",
      "They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section.\n",
      "Moreover, once these steps are taken, they may require years to make themselves felt.\n",
      "They must, therefore, be related to long-range development plans.\n",
      "If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach, the United States, as the principal supplier of external aid, must be prepared to give long-term commitments.\n",
      "The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources, to set targets toward which they should be working, to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention, and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves, all on a realistic long-term basis, will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them.\n",
      "If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities, they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required.\n",
      "Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments.\n",
      "You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis, the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs, come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known.\n",
      "Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people.\n",
      "General leave to extend\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record;;\n",
      "and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks.\n",
      "Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts??\n",
      "It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker, the Honorable Sam Rayburn.\n",
      "I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas.\n",
      "I did so because I agree with so many here today, that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States.\n",
      "For the dignity, the influence, and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country.\n",
      "To honor him is to honor ourselves.\n",
      "Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me.\n",
      "At that time, he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need, to speak about my background, my hopes, my views on various national and local topics, and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time.\n",
      "In conclusion, he wished me well -- and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself, he asked to be remembered to my wife and children.\n",
      "In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle.\n",
      "He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House, and in the legislative accomplishments of this session, he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the Nation witnessed these contests, he rose, even as admitted by those who differed with him, to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan.\n",
      "I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant.\n",
      "one who is thoroughly human, who affects no dignity, and who is endowed with real ability, genuine worth, and sterling honesty -- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long.\n",
      "May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come.\n",
      "It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise, respect, and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn.\n",
      "In this hour of crisis, the wisdom, the dedication, the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength.\n",
      "It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades.\n",
      "Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country.\n",
      "But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam Rayburn has made as an individual, as a legislator, as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator, to the majestic progress of this Nation.\n",
      "It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs, the aspirations, the interests of my district and my State.\n",
      "What Sam Rayburn's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one's own community, one's own district, one's own State, and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time.\n",
      "In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community, our district, our State.\n",
      "And, if we follow the Rayburn pattern, as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it, then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country.\n",
      "For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district.\n",
      "This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn's career, up to this hour, teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government.\n",
      "More than that, Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition.\n",
      "Sam Rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions.\n",
      "This means much to the American tradition.\n",
      "It is an answer in its way, individual and highly dramatic, to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics.\n",
      "It is, I insist, hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated, and because it goes so deep.\n",
      "But this we know: Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor, decency, and self-respect.\n",
      "I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose.\n",
      "And Sam Rayburn is a great man -- one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation.\n",
      "I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn, stalwart Texan and great American, not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay, but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress.\n",
      "Speaker Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker's chair.\n",
      "But to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's Record.\n",
      "No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker, this great legislator, this great Texan, this great American.\n",
      "My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today.\n",
      "Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States.\n",
      "of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today, and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy international seas.\n",
      "I prefer to speak, however, of Sam Rayburn, the person, rather than Sam Rayburn, the American institution.\n",
      "No one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world, and I shall never forget his moving talks, delivered in simple yet eloquent words, upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government.\n",
      "Above all, he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman.\n",
      "On September 16, Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date, and in expressing my esteem for that notable American, Sam Rayburn.\n",
      "The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940.\n",
      "The automobile maintenance unit, or motor pool, came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time.\n",
      "Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases.\n",
      "Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes.\n",
      "The legislature's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles.\n",

      "It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes.\n",
      "States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency, the individual, or to a central pool.\n",
      "However, they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures.\n",
      "Flat payments over $50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles.\n",
      "It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island.\n",
      "Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940.\n",
      "Those that are available shed little light.\n",
      "The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917.\n",
      "It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old.\n"

      "The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and'30s.\n",
      "At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties.\n",
      "And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth.\n",
      "But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees.\n",
      "In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now.\n",
      "The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them.\n",
      "Prior to 1942, automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned.\n",
      "It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles, who was to drive, when and where repairs were to be made, where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters.\n",
      "The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual.\n",
      "It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation.\n",
      "In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration, an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government.\n",
      "The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner: ``\n",
      "Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made.\n",
      "The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars.\n",
      "One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956, while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35%, the total maintenance cost increased only 11%.\n",
      "In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles, on July 1, 1958, the actual title to every vehicle was transferred, by Executive Order, to the Division of Methods, Research and Office Services.\n",
      "The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management, assignment, and replacement of all vehicles.\n",
      "This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs( in light of depreciation) become excessive.\n",
      "Moreover, it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet;;\n",
      "for example, if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year, their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years, rather than 44,000 miles( and related higher maintenance costs) and 16,000 miles respectively''.\n",
      "Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles, pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles.\n",
      "They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled, the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year.\n",
      "One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities.\n",
      "Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more.\n",
      "Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made.\n",
      "Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff, and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders.\n",
      "Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public.\n",
      "The reasons are obvious:( 1) the state is buying in quantity, and( 2) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay.\n",
      "Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers.\n",
      "In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool, cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier.\n",
      "The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later.\n",
      "The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles.\n",
      "The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration.\n",
      "There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well.\n",
      "For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax.\n",
      "Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years.\n",
      "At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well.\n",
      "Thus, there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and, in addition, must give assistance to its local governments.\n",
      "Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes, as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level.\n",
      "Notwithstanding state aid, the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax.\n",
      "Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off'' nature due possibly to several reasons:( 1) local assessors, in the main, are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs,( 2) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult, and( 3) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property.\n",
      "These problems are not local to Rhode Island, but are recognized as common to all states.\n",
      "Although the laws of the various states, in general, specify the situs of property, i.e., residence or domicile of the owner, or location of the property, the exceptions regarding boats, airplanes, mobile homes, etc., seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.\n",
      "Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated.\n",
      "It also provides for the taxation of all personal property, belonging to inhabitants of the state, both tangible and intangible, and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state.\n",
      "Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute, this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property'' situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated.\n",
      "This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31.\n",
      "Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category, as well as motor vehicles.\n",
      "The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration, and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged.\n",
      "Obviously, it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December.\n",
      "In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes, in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft.\n",
      "A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes, on December 31, 1960, from the Newport Airpark in Middletown, to the North Central Airport in Smithfield.\n",
      "Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property, both tangible and intangible, shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve( 12) months next preceding the first day of April in each year''.\n",
      "The Smithfield tax assessor, in turn, claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town, in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated''.\n",
      "This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors, who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem.\n",
      "This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established, or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted.\n",
      "The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property.\n",
      "A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units''.\n",
      "The Institute of Public Administration, in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959, recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job''.\n",
      "The resulting setup, it was declared, `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island''.\n",
      "To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property, a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island.\n",
      "These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time.\n",
      "In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats, airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles, nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not.\n",
      "The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations.\n",
      "One assessor checked boats only, another trailers and tractors, one mentioned house trailers, and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type.\n",
      "It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation, but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property, and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes.\n",
      "Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats.\n",
      "It would seem, then, that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property.\n",
      "So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive.\n",
      "Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind.\n",
      "Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership.\n",
      "Fifteen stated that it was according to location, four by residence of the owner, and nineteen did not answer.\n",
      "Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property, and only five were opposed.\n",
      "On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now.\n",
      "It is not clear, however, whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats, trailers, aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.\n",
      "Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner.\n",
      "Of those who have an opinion, it seems that assessment by location is preferred.\n",
      "To summarize, it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property, that assessors would like to see an improvement, and of those who have an opinion, that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge.\n",
      "Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property, but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than'' a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting.\n",
      "It has been obvious to the assessors, particularly those in shore communities, that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach.\n",
      "No satisfactory solution has been found, but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors.\n",
      "It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars, excluding commercial boats.\n",
      "It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation.\n",
      "It is known that at least five towns( Barrington, Bristol, Narragansett, Newport and Westerly) place some value on some boats for tax purposes.\n",
      "However, few are taxed, and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations.\n",
      "Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law.\n",
      "Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season, but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close.\n",
      "The assessors' association, meeting at Narragansett in September 1960, devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem.\n",
      "Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction, totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000;;\n",
      "What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation, Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry, new plants, and new jobs.\n",
      "Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation, Cornell-Dubilier, Photek, Inc. Division of Textron, Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry, W. R. Cobb Company, and Mays Manufacturing Company.\n",
      "Aids to small business\n",
      "Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries, small business is also afforded considerable attention.\n",
      "Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations, where to obtain specifications, and follow-ups concerning qualification.\n",
      "During the past year, 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers.\n",
      "In addition, the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses;;\n",
      "how and where to apply for financial assistance;;\n",
      "information concerning patents, copyrights and trade marks, availability of technical reports, and other subjects of interest to small business.\n",
      "This office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include: statistics on markets abroad;;\n",
      "During the year 1960, this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce, and made 73 field visits.\n",
      "Our media advertising continued, during 1960, its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing, plant availabilities, and location advantages.\n",
      "We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here.\n",
      "To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers, our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000, and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000.\n",
      "Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal( Eastern and Midwestern editions) which averaged two prominent ads per month, and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and, for the west coast, the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal( Pacific Coast edition).\n",
      "In addition to the regular schedule, advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times, Boston Herald, American Banker, Electronic News and, for local promotion, the Providence Sunday Journal.\n",
      "The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics, plastics, pharmaceutical, and business machine manufacturers, and to publishers.\n",
      "Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959.\n",
      "Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event.\n",
      "A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals.\n",
      "Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island, it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division.\n",
      "More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients.\n",
      "Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference, letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors.\n",
      "The Industrial Division published, in 1960, a new, attractive industrial brochure, `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry'', and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers( to be printed shortly), and for a new space catalogue.\n",
      "Stated in its simplest terms, the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island.\n",
      "The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council, which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning.\n",
      "First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state.\n",
      "Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` Metropolian Planning( in Rhode Island) means, or should mean, state planning'', the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems.\n",
      "It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government.\n",
      "To this end, the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available, on a shared cost basis, technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff.\n",
      "On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources, plans for the provision of essential services( such as water) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries, within the framework of the state plan.\n",
      "The work program, as it was originally proposed, was to take five years to complete.\n",
      "Recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated.\n",
      "Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program, the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile, and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, covering the entire state.\n",
      "With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended, the planning division began a one year program July 1, 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program.\n",
      "Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information, great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.\n",
      "The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning.\n",
      "The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and, like the other two inventory projects, are scheduled for completion July 1, 1961.\n",
      "It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island.\n",
      "However, a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government.\n",
      "These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes, to borrow money, own property, sue and be sued, and in general to exercise normal corporate powers.\n",
      "Unlike cities and towns, however, they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits.\n",
      "It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government.\n",
      "In addition to the collection of service charges, the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000.\n",
      "A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report.\n",
      "In sixteen states, the fiscal year ending of the cities( June 30) is the same as that of the state: Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Hawaii).\n",
      "However, only Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity.\n",
      "The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule, that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn.\n",
      "It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts.\n",
      "The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools, which expend the largest share of local disbursements.\n",
      "When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons;;\n",
      "Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.\n",
      "This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year.\n",
      "It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year.\n",
      "Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below:\n",
      "It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax, the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap;;\n",
      "The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships.\n",
      "These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle.\n",
      "the other, is how to finance the transition.\n",
      "It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city.\n",
      "Fortunately, there are no cities or towns in the state, with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change.\n",
      "Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases, but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely.\n",
      "The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them.\n",
      "First, the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula.\n",
      "Second, the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will, of itself, improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns.\n",
      "There are at least two problems to consider: one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar;;\n",
      "the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary.\n",
      "Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar.\n",
      "Plans vary from the `` talking stage'' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end.\n",
      "What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them.\n",
      "An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought.\n",
      "However, it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved.\n",
      "The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island, based on a July 1 to June 30 year, are shown below.\n",
      "Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it.\n",
      "This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year.\n",
      "Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity.\n",
      "Two cities to be considered, Providence and Cranston, are an enigma.\n",
      "However, neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year.\n",
      "The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them.\n",
      "In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30, they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months, commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30.\n",
      "The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30.\n",
      "Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year, the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3.\n",
      "It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements.\n",
      "In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes.\n",
      "In addition, no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition.\n",
      "These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible;;\n",
      "each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars, the financial condition of the treasuries, and the length of the transition interval.\n",
      "Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.\n",
      "As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War, this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State, but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington, putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.\n",
      "The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony;;\n",
      "and now, therefore, do I, John A. Notte, Jr., governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th, 1961, as Rhode Island Heritage Week, advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants, craft shops, museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week.\n",

      "In view of the increasing shortage of usable surface and ground water in many parts of the Nation and the importance of finding new sources of supply to meet its present and future water needs, it is the policy of the Congress to provide for the development of practicable low-cost means for the large-scale production of water of a quality suitable for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water, and for studies and research related thereto.\n",

      "The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency, established in 1949, has published, since January 1950, The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services.\n",
      "Its supplement, The Medical Technicians Bulletin, supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel.\n",
      "These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin, published continuously from 1907 through 1959, as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department, published from 1922 to 1949.\n",
      "In addition, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin.\n",
      "Additionally, on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations, the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized, in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage.\n",
      "From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960, 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published.\n",
      "Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest, and departments devoted to military medical news, reviews of new books, and other features of interest to officers of the medical services.\n",
      "The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled, `` This Is Your A.M.A.''.\n",
      "Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal, the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting.\n",
      "This resulted in an improved appearance, but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds.\n",
      "The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds.\n",
      "The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles, beginning in the fall of 1960, on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.\n",
      "The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions, so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces.\n",
      "This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method, and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago.\n",
      "Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product, beryllium fluoride.\n",
      "The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion.\n",
      "In one of these, an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure, a major goal was achieved.\n",
      "A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion.\n",
      "The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil( approximately Af) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera.\n",
      "The opening action is obtained when a capacitor, charged to high voltage, is suddenly discharged through the foil.\n",
      "During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line, thus allowing light to pass into the camera.\n",
      "Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds.\n",
      "The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil.\n",
      "The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and, perhaps, planetary atmospheres.\n",
      "in interstellar gas, concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient, as compared to the Af hydrogen atom's Af required for detection of the 21-cm line.\n",
      "This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor, which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range, where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity.\n",
      "Success in observing these spectral lines has so far, apparently, been confined to the laboratory;;\n",
      "extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported.\n",
      "The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af.\n",
      "An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used, with helium gas as the thermometric fluid, to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 Af.\n",
      "Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement, and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer.\n",
      "Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.\n",
      "Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af.\n",
      "The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature'' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af.\n",
      "Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars.\n",
      "The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point.\n",
      "However, the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb) from the liquid helium surface.\n",
      "It has also been observed, in helium 2, that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer.\n",
      "This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer.\n",
      "In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow.\n",
      "Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm, an overload of 300 psi, applied for a period of one day, results in an uncertainty in the pressure of, at most, one millimeter of mercury.\n",
      "Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present.\n",
      "The results of the study, based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air, will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusion, and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density.\n",
      "In March, 1961, representatives of the national laboratories of Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, U.S.S.R., United States, and West Germany, met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af.\n",
      "These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory.\n",
      "The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack, General Chairman, and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld, Program Chairman.\n",
      "In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards, spectroscopy, solid state physics, interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress, the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics.\n",
      "The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared, the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies, and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation.\n",
      "Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities.\n",
      "A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements.\n",
      "A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent.\n",
      "Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities.\n",
      "New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success.\n",

      "Mr. Speaker, for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have.\n",
      "The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes, losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers, to name but two.\n",
      "And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied, ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service.\n",
      "Instead we have stood idly by, watched our commuter railroad service decline, and have failed to offer a helping hand.\n",
      "Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2,, total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957.\n",
      "At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads, a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake& Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore& Ohio railroads.\n",
      "The New York Central has pointed out that this control, if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, would give the combined C.& O.- B.& O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central.\n",
      "Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful, but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area.\n",
      "The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C.& O.- B.& O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues.\n",
      "These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services.\n",
      "If these services are to be maintained, the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible''.\n",
      "A blow to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself, but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient, reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city.\n",
      "There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C.& O.- B.& O. merger scheme'' --\n",
      "The logic of creating a strong, balanced, competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B.& O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.\n",
      "Detailed studies of the plan were well underway.\n",
      "Though far from completion, these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned, their investors, their customers, their users, and to the public at large.\n",
      "In the light of the facts at hand, however, New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest''.\n",
      "Obviously, the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge.\n",
      "However, there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss.\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper, the New York Times, on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command.\n",
      "Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement.\n",
      "I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times.\n",
      "Mr. Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained.\n",
      "I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes, a member of the Times staff since 1946, has been appointed as editorial page editor.\n",
      "I should like at this time, Mr. Speaker, to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism.\n",
      "My heartiest congratulations go to their successors, Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes, who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times.\n",
      "Mr. Speaker, in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine.\n",
      "Under leave to extend my remarks, I include the relevant portion of my newsletter, together with the text of the article from the U.S. News& World Report: `` your Congressman, Samuel S. Stratton, reports from Washington, May 1, 1961\n",
      "Cuban S.S.R.: Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week, there was at least one positive benefit, and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base.\n",
      "In fact, one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment.\n",
      "Somehow, the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark, blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home.\n",
      "Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear, President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this, even if we had to go it alone.\n",
      "But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board.\n",
      "For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks.\n",
      "But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job.\n",
      "You can see it, for example, in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos;;\n",
      "Personally, I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba.\n",
      "A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would be a relatively simple operation to carry out, and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere''.\n",
      "Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas.\n",
      "In it they see a way to isolate Cuba, stop infiltration, maybe finish Castro, too.\n",
      "This is the question now facing President Kennedy: How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere??\n",
      "On April 25, the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered.\n",
      "Another strategy -- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington: a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world, destroy Castro.\n",
      "Blockade, in the view of military and civilian experts, could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine.\n",
      "It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America.\n",
      "It would be the most severe reprisal, short of declared war, that the United States could invoke against Castro.\n",
      "It is the strategy of blockade, therefore, that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials, Members of Congress, officers in the Pentagon.\n",
      "Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces, each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.\n",
      "The Navy, on April 25, announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean, increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba.\n",
      "To round out the blockading force, submarines would be needed -- to locate, identify and track approaching vessels.\n",
      "A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces.\n",
      "the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it;;\n",
      "Once these conditions of international law are met, countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk.\n",
      "They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated.\n",
      "It could, by avoiding direct intervention, provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.\n",
      "From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236, 66th Congress, the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States, by means of grants-in-aid, to return disabled men and women to productive, gainful employment.\n",
      "Up to this time and for the next eight years, the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training, counseling, and placement on a job.\n",
      "Recognizing the limitations of such a program, the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113, which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised the financing structure.\n",
      "Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943, the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled.\n",
      "To assist the States, therefore, in rehabilitating handicapped individuals, `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities'', the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954( P. L. 565).\n",
      "These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities, for more sheltered and `` half-way'' workshops, for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel, for more comprehensive services to individuals( particularly to the homebound and the blind), and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness.\n",
      "Under the law as it existed until 1943, the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population, matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis.\n",
      "Throughout these years, the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act.\n",
      "The first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section.\n",
      "The following table shows, for selected years, the authorizations, appropriations, allotment base, Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program:\n",
      "In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services, Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on( 1) need, as measured by a State's population, and( 2) fiscal capacity, as measured by its per capita income.\n",

      "Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years, but it is `` likely'' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part'' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont's capacity.\n",
      "The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest.\n",

      "No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\n",
      "This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.\n",
      "Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation, but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability, appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation.\n",
      "Thus, a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's decision.\n",
      "Indeed, as already noted, the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly'' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies.\n",
      "This, however, did not bar finding that Du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors;;\n",
      "that these products constituted a `` line of commerce'' within the meaning of the Clayton Act;;\n",
      "that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial;;\n",

      "The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute.\n",
      "We repeat, that the test of a violation of 7 is whether, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints.\n",
      "The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition.\n",
      "On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion, the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief.\n",
      "The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this: ``\n",
      "The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination, after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute.\n",

      "This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court.\n",
      "The first pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25, 1957.\n",
      "At the outset, the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court.\n",
      "The Government, deeming these suggestions inadequate, had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont's shares of General Motors.\n",
      "Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program, but stated that if the court desired, or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable, the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days.\n"

      "If, in the trustee's judgment, `` reasonable market conditions'' did not prevail during any given year, he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period.\n",

      "The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits.\n",
      "The measure, for federal income tax purposes, of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution.\n",
      "The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana, Delaware, and the stockholders of Delaware, and deposited with the trustee, would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate.\n",
      "Under its plan Du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares.\n",
      "Christiana and Delaware would, in turn, be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders.\n",
      "Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders.\n",
      "On June 6, 1958, General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal.\n",
      "It argued, inter alia, that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont, with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors, among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions;;\n",
      "that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks, with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies;;\n",
      "that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital;;\n",
      "and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity.\n",
      "General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest'' as required by the mandate of this Court.\n",
      "These plans, like Du Pont's, contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, except that officers and directors of the three companies, their spouses, and other people living in their households, as well as other specified persons, were to be totally disenfranchised.\n",
      "It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense'' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk, or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship.\n",
      "While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view, the concept of the `` oneness'' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage.\n",
      "By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship, the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States, 362 U.S. 525, where the Court held that, under the circumstances of that case, a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection.\n",

      "Petitioner was not entitled, either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial, to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, since he was furnished a resume of it, did not challenge its accuracy, and showed no particular need for the original report.\n",
      "This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services, in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 604,622, 50, U.S.C. App. Aj 462( A).\n",
      "Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious objector, contends that he was denied due process, both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial.\n",
      "He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board, and, further, that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n",
      "The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents.\n",
      "Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n",
      "We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407( 1955), and United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S. 1( 1953), and therefore affirm the judgment.\n",
      "His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses, employed at night by a sugar producer.\n",
      "He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion, devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching.\n",
      "He again stated that he was `` a regular minister'';;\n",
      "that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly'', in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties, and that he opposed war in any form.\n",
      "On April 1, 1953, after some six months of full-time `` pioneering'', petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching, but failed to so notify his local board.\n",
      "In a periodic review, the local board on July 30, 1953, reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner, because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home.\n",
      "Upon administrative approval of the reclassification, he was ordered to report for induction on June 11, 1956, but failed to do so.\n",
      "In his report to the Attorney General, the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service.\n",
      "Its ground for this recommendation was that, while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17, 1956( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date), that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching, the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and, on the contrary, had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions.\n",
      "It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities.\n",
      "His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated'', the Department concluded, that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and, consequently, upon his sincerity and good faith''.\n",
      "In his answer thereto, he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956, and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering'' was in 1952.\n",
      "Upon return of the file to the local board, petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so.\n",
      "Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity, before its final recommendation to the appeal board, to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching.\n",
      "But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file.\n",
      "He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times, and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer.\n",
      "This he failed to do, asserting that he did not know it to be in his file.\n",
      "Apparently he never took the trouble to find out.\n",
      "Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board.\n",
      "After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board, that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial.\n",
      "We found in Gonzales v. United States, supra, that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant.\n",
      "We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut( the Department's) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board, the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification''.\n",
      "We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention, which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it.\n",
      "As was said in Gonzales, `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered' final' in the courts, not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact.\n",
      "At his trial, petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer, Evensen, as well as his report thereon.\n",
      "Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice.\n",
      "Section 6(j) of the Act, as we have held, does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file.\n",
      "But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant.\n",
      "While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the registrant's file, this requirement was eliminated in 1952.\n",
      "Moreover, the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental, is directed to the Attorney General and, of course, is not the recommendation of the Department.\n",
      "It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice, of which the Attorney General receives many, and to which he may give his approval or rejection.\n",
      "It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board.\n",
      "It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board.\n",
      "Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board.\n",
      "Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file.\n",
      "Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board, petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed.\n",
      "It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial.\n",
      "In addition, petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes.\n",
      "In the light of these circumstances, as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation, which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record, we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes.\n",
      "Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial.\n",
      "He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy.\n",
      "He bases his present contention on the general right to explore, indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume.\n",
      "There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review, within the selective service system, entitles[ conscientious objectors] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection''.\n",
      "Even if we were not bound by Nugent, petitioner here would not be entitled to the report.\n",
      "The recommendation of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file, not on an FBI report.\n",
      "With this enlarged role in mind, I should like to make a few suggestions: What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world.\n",
      "That means that, if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership, we must think in terms of the total context of our situation.\n",
      "It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense.\n",
      "It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous, profitable, and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce.\n",
      "We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs'' to resolve differences between this and other departments.\n",
      "Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy.\n",
      "I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action.\n",
      "Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead, we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present.\n",
      "The movement of events is so fast, the pace so severe, that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present.\n",
      "If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly, that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs.\n",
      "Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control.\n",
      "What I am suggesting is that when we delay, or when we fail to act, we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties.\n",
      "I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies.\n",
      "We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department.\n",
      "We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome, that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top.\n",
      "I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas.\n",
      "The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function, regardless of rank.\n",
      "Further, I would hope that we could pay attention to little things.\n",
      "While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world, I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort.\n",
      "To cite only a few examples: The wrong man in the wrong position, perhaps even in a junior position abroad, can be a source of great harm to our policy;;\n",
      "the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City, or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital, can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for.\n",
      "Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them.\n",
      "I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them.\n",
      "If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington, it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas.\n",
      "He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country.\n",
      "He is expected to supervise, to encourage, to direct, to assist in any way he can.\n",
      "If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong, we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action.\n",
      "It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years, in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means, and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government.\n",
      "I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces.\n",
      "Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine.\n",
      "The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli: an idea in his own head, the suggestions of a colleague, a question from the Secretary or the President, a proposal by another department, a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad, the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies, a news item read at the breakfast table, a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference, a speech by a Senator or Congressman, an article in a periodical, a resolution from a national organization, a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad, et cetera, ad infinitum.\n",
      "For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself, and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer.\n",
      "Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind, he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because, if no tolerable answer can be found, it may have to be changed into one which can be answered.\n",
      "Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem, facts which he knows can never be complete, and the general background, much of which has already been lost to history.\n",
      "He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play, taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions.\n",
      "He knows that he must give the expert his place, but he knows that he must also keep him in it.\n",
      "He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action, including doing nothing.\n",
      "He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog.\n",
      "But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy, well-established precedents, the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties, basic statutes, and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves, in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department.\n",
      "He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted.\n",
      "He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance.\n",
      "He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem.\n",
      "He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp.\n",
      "Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted??\n",
      "How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted??\n",
      "If action is indicated, what kind of action is relevant to the problem??\n",
      "For, if so, the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem.\n",
      "What type of action can hope to win public support, first in this country and then abroad??\n",
      "For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it.\n",
      "He is interested in public opinion for two reasons: first, because it is important in itself, and, second, because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.\n",
      "And, given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support??\n",
      "We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action.\n",
      "In the first place our business is foreign policy, and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem.\n",
      "If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks, we should realize that this is raw, undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership.\n",
      "We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action.\n",
      "I doubt, for example, that, 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan, any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals.\n",
      "The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political, military, economic, financial, legal, legislative, procedural, administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control.\n",
      "While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex, there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women.\n",
      "Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid.\n",
      "Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance.\n",
      "Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living.\n",
      "Some special health requirements might have to be met.\n",
      "For example, it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers.\n",
      "For readjustment to the U.S., volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service, based on the length of time served.\n",
      "The Peace Corps, therefore, offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development.\n",
      "The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear, with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action, with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer.\n",
      "The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost.\n",
      "Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses.\n",
      "The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.\n",
      "There would, however, be a variety of other skills -- medical, agricultural, engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects.\n",
      "Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation, the readiness to receive such manpower, or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country.\n",
      "A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters.\n",
      "Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility.\n",
      "But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers, and that if the volunteers are well chosen, they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends.\n",
      "It is important, however, that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community.\n",
      "In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations, we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee.\n",
      "We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands.\n",
      "Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach.\n",
      "The Peace Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower.\n",
      "If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds, in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program, this will be a hopeful sign to the world.\n",
      "Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year.\n",
      "Specifically, Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses, unions, civic organizations and the public at large.\n",
      "An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding.\n",
      "Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps, so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel.\n",
      "The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies, universities, international organizations, and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored.\n",
      "No matter how well conceived and efficiently run, there probably will be failures.\n",
      "It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions.\n",
      "It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world.\n",
      "With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas, millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before.\n",
      "The letters home, the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps, the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world.\n",
      "The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting.\n",
      "As you said in your State of the Union message, `` The problems are towering and unprecedented -- and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well''.\n",
      "I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower.\n",
      "The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization.\n",
      "In addition, by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall.\n",
      "Our own freedom, and the future of freedom around the world, depend, in a very real sense, on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity, liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance and poverty.\n",
      "One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics, and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages, the mountains, the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations.\n",
      "The vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools, construct development projects, demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages, and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge.\n",
      "To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers, sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations.\n",
      "This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work.\n",
      "They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments, acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice.\n",
      "There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them.\n",
      "In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing.\n",
      "This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972.\n",
      "The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment.\n",
      "Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located, as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs, including( A) big-game, gamebird, and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands,( B) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments, and( C) participation in planning, inspection, and control phases of all habitat improvement, land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States, other Federal agencies, and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values.\n",
      "The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet.\n",
      "About 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease, 20 percent to insects, 17 percent to fire, and 18 percent to weather, animals, and various other causes.\n",
      "The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services.\n",
      "This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods, and a more intensive application of a program of prevention, detection, and control of insect and disease infestations.\n",
      "In addition to direct protection measures, more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease.\n",
      "In the 10-year period, it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention, detection, and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period.\n",
      "Intensification of present activities through( A) quicker, more extensive, and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks;;\n",
      "( B) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage;;\n",
      "( C) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic.\n",
      "Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production.\n",
      "The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed.\n",
      "Initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites.\n",
      "Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses.\n",
      "It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands, all critical watersheds, and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads.\n",
      "An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation.\n",
      "Expansion, modernization, and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards.\n",
      "This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort, detection, skilled fire-fighting crews, and equipment use.\n",
      "Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas.\n",
      "Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known.\n",
      "These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another.\n",
      "Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties, this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed.\n",
      "It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests.\n",
      "These roads are largely of less than highway standards, and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests.\n",
      "It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads, and 80,000 miles of trails, constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood, water, forage, and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis.\n",
      "It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds.\n",
      "the volume of timber that can be marketed, especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises;;\n",
      "the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire, windstorm, insects, and disease;;\n",
      "The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible.\n",
      "Furthermore, roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years.\n",
      "Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve.\n",
      "The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services.\n",
      "Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails, along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails.\n",
      "Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber, but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices.\n",
      "Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period.\n",
      "In some units, National Forest ownership is well blocked together.\n",
      "One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land, or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land.\n",
      "Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands.\n",
      "And some, which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes, are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation, and are contributing nothing to the economy;;\n",
      "there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed.\n",
      "The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development, or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands.\n",
      "The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care, mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other.\n",
      "Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us, from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war.\n",
      "The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men;;\n",
      "If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war, their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces.\n",
      "I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare.\n",
      "I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity.\n",
      "I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000, respectively, to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961.\n",
      "These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives.\n",
      "These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion, an increase of $187 million over 1960, reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel, more dependents, an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay, and social security tax increases( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960).\n",
      "Traditionally, rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel.\n",
      "The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1, 1958.\n",
      "I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates.\n",
      "-- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961, which is $184 million more than in 1960.\n",
      "A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program, as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential.\n",
      "In total, these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures, such as reduced numbers of units and installations, smaller inventories of major equipment, and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces.\n",
      "As I have stated previously, the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles.\n",
      "Accordingly, if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session, I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.\n",
      "Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska, and its early enactment is desirable.\n",
      "In 1961, these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion, compared to $19.3 billion in 1960.\n",
      "New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement( excluding amounts for related research and construction) totals $4,753 million, which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960.\n",
      "I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider.\n",
      "This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events.\n",
      "For example, the importance of the Regulus 2, a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines, was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines.\n",
      "The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles.\n",
      "Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational, it was decided to stop further work on the project.\n",
      "This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft, particularly our heavy bombers.\n",
      "The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development, in determining the most satisfactory rate of development, and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it.\n",
      "-- The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war.\n",
      "One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70, a long-range supersonic bomber.\n",
      "This aircraft, which was planned for initial operational use about 1965, would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems, all of which are scheduled to become available earlier.\n",

      "With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2, of the Agreement, the understanding of the Government of the United States of America, with respect to both paragraphs 1( B) and 1( C) of Article 2, is as follows:( 1)\n",
      "Local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the Government of India for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1( B) and 1( C) of Article 2, of the Agreement upon the presentation of such documentation as the United States may specify.\n",
      "The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1( B) and 1( C) of Article 2, of the Agreement, to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects( including the cost thereof).\n",
      "The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project, or until the expiration of three years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United States, whichever is later.\n",
      "The two Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents, correspondence, memoranda and other records involving transactions relating to agreed projects.\n",
      "The Government of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects, and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto.\n",
      "This broad delegation leaves within our discretion( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive, and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided.\n",
      "The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast( AM) band, from 540 kc. to 1600 kc..\n",
      "Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies, each interferes to some extent with reception of the other.\n",
      "The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal, or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors, among the principal ones being the distance between the stations, their respective radiated power, and, of particular significance here, the time of day.\n",
      "With the existence of these many factors, some of them variable, it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances.\n",
      "Rather, such assignments are made, as they must be, on the basis of certain overall rules and standards, representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem, taking into account for each situation some of the variables( e.g., power and station separations) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation.\n",
      "An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable.\n",
      "By this standard, it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved, objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B's signal at that point.\n",
      "The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service.\n",
      "A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies.\n",
      "This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners, resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere.\n",
      "But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere, thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service, via skywave, at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal, and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies.\n",
      "Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions, it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band, with many more stations operating during the day than at night.\n",
      "It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions, and vice versa, is not an instantaneous process, but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset, and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise.\n",
      "However, in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations, representing an averaging of conditions, and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions.\n",
      "It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset, respectively, should be used for this purpose.\n",
      "Class 2, stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset( for daytime class 2, stations) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1, station where located west of the class 2, station( for limited-time class 2, stations).\n",
      "The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3, stations operating on regional channels, which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other.\n",
      "With respect to nighttime assignments, the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves( figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules) giving average skywave values.\n",
      "It was recognized that skywave signals, because of their reflected nature, are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength.\n",
      "For this reason, the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary'' in our rules, as compared to the steadier, more reliable groundwave `` primary service'', and, for both skywave service and skywave interference, signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service, 10 percent of the time for skywave interference.\n",
      "The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation.\n",
      "To provide some service to all listeners;;\n",
      "To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible;;\n",
      "To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible.\n",
      "Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number, these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized, and to the extent that each is realized, there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others.\n",
      "Accordingly, the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies, and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations.\n",
      "Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1, -- A or Class 1, -- B clear-channel stations, designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and( at night) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances, being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective.\n",
      "In dealing with these frequencies, the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant;;\n",
      "the other objectives were subordinated to it.\n",
      "The class 1, stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference.\n",
      "With respect to skywave service rendered at night, class 1, -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1, -- A operation, and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received;;\n",
      "class 1, -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference.\n",
      "But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service, interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it.\n",
      "With respect to other frequencies, these are designated as regional or local, and assigned for use by class 3, and class 4, stations, respectively, stations operating generally with lower power.\n",
      "In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies, the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities, and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible.\n",
      "As mentioned, the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service, free from destructive interference.\n",
      "During nighttime hours, because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing, no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels, if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it.\n",
      "Therefore, under our longstanding allocation rules, on some of these channels no station other than the dominant( class 1) -- A) station is permitted to operate at night, so that the 1, -- A station can render service, interference free, wherever it can be received.\n",
      "On the remainder of the clear channels, the dominant( class 1) -- B stations are protected as described above, and the relatively small number of secondary( class 2)) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1, stations.\n",
      "In the daytime, on the other hand, since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient, it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels.\n",
      "Additional class 2, assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1, stations or to each other, and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities.\n",
      "Such additional daytime class 2, assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies, and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them.\n",
      "Similarly, on the regional channels many class 3, stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power.\n",
      "Essentially, the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision( in 1938-1939) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset, is sound as a basis for AM allocations, or whether, in the light of later developments and new understanding, skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account, and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours.\n",
      "Since then, there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it, leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena.\n",
      "In 1947, affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours, from class 2, stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference.\n",

      "and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today --, in the industrialized West, these social evils substantially do not exist.\n",
      "That is, to put it realistically, they had to run their businesses at a profit, or they had to get the votes to get elected.\n",
      "Nevertheless, they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers'' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage, with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result, in turn, that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase.\n",
      "But as all understand who have eyes to see, nothing of the kind has happened;;\n",
      "The gulf between the `` rich'' and the `` poor'' has narrowed, in the industrialized Western world, to the point that the word `` poor'' is hardly applicable.\n",
      "And the reason this could happen is clear: men of government, business men, lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity.\n",
      "Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit;;\n",

      "Sir Henry Sumner Maine, a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with, wrote his brilliant legal generalization, that `` the progress of society is from status to contract''.\n",

      "For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future.\n",
      "But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose, men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not, cannot, progress.\n",
      "The eternal truth is that progress -- due, as it always is, to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart.\n",
      "And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report, let me enlighten them with the truths that, under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation, and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed, untrammeled in every way, toward their discoveries, their creative efforts for the good of mankind.\n",

      "With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution, Brown& Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder, Joseph R. Brown, and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology.\n",
      "He was early exposed to the mechanical world, and in his youth often helped his father, David Brown, master clock and watchmaker, as he plied his trade.\n",
      "This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833, under the name D. Brown& Son, a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown& Sharpe.\n",
      "In 1838, a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois, settling on a land grant in his declining years.\n",
      "Joseph Brown continued in business by himself, quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world.\n",
      "But his business also grew, and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire.\n",
      "It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12, 1848, Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book, in his characteristically cryptic style, `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice''.\n",
      "The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown, for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm;;\n",
      "Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering'', and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time.\n",
      "The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine.\n",
      "Several efforts were made in this direction, and though not all of them survive to this day, the Brown& Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today.\n",
      "Curious as to what made it work, he built a crude model of it in wood, and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread, enabling the crude machine to take stitches.\n",
      "When he showed this model as his `` solution'' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated, he was told he was `` wrong'', and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine, which was unknown to him in detail, used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one.\n",
      "Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine, which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown& Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture.\n",
      "The new work was a boon to the partnership, not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment.\n",
      "The turret screw machine, now known as the Brown& Sharpe hand screw machine, takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine.\n",
      "Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret, by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock, and reversible tap and die holders.\n",
      "In 1861, Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills.\n",
      "At that time, during the Civil War, Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files.\n",
      "Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth, but they were good for only one sharpening.\n",
      "As soon as the time came for re-sharpening, the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made.\n",
      "This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form.\n",
      "The micrometer caliper, as a common workshop tool, also owes much to J. R. Brown.\n",
      "Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor( it was a French idea), it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use.\n",
      "So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868, they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown& Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day.\n",
      "The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine.\n",
      "This machine, like its milling counterpart, was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world.\n",
      "Along with J. R. Brown's other major developments, the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown& Sharpe for many years to come.\n",
      "Following Mr. Brown's death, there came forward in the Brown& Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company.\n",
      "As head of the firm Darling& Swartz, Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown& Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's.\n",
      "Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892, a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling, Brown& Sharpe, and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark.\n",
      "Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale, whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown, and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown& Sharpe to manufacture gages, and therefore its products, with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world.\n",
      "Also important on the Brown& Sharpe scene, at the turn of the century, was Mr. Richmond Viall, Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910.\n",
      "He was an ardent champion of the Brown& Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company.\n",
      "In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown& Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad.\n",
      "During the early part of this century, the Brown& Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world.\n",
      "During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown.\n",
      "It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines, from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business, from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines.\n",
      "Recently added is the Brown& Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development.\n",
      "Net income was $2,557,111, or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding, as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959, adjusted to the same number of shares.\n",
      "Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960.\n",
      "This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development.\n",
      "In spite of the fact that our largest market, the textile industry, was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity, we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959.\n",
      "However, the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961.\n",
      "In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery, a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment, enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis, could, if adopted, have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years.\n",
      "Such a depreciation policy would also, we believe, prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries, thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange.\n",
      "Our research and development program, serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world, continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona.\n",
      "This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality, fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money.\n",
      "Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment, in terms of efficiency and versatility.\n",
      "On this basis, our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings.\n",
      "Much of this necessary increase in research and development, though properly chargeable to current expenses, is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity, usually over a period of several years.\n",
      "In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines.\n",
      "This machine, operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute, is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today.\n",
      "Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills.\n",
      "Later in the year, additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns.\n",
      "These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds, larger yarn packages, and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn.\n",
      "This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year.\n",
      "This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry.\n",
      "The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder.\n",
      "it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle, and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted.\n",
      "A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns.\n",
      "It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed.\n",
      "This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute.\n",
      "It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time.\n",
      "We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field.\n",
      "We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods, or components for industrial products, and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction.\n",
      "In addition to its major effort on fuel cells, Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields, both under contract for the Defense Department, other government agencies and for our own account.\n",
      "PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs.\n",
      "We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity.\n",
      "Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances, and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities.\n",
      "Construction is well along, and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year.\n",
      "All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick.\n",
      "However, its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity, permit more efficient manufacturing, and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs.\n",
      "A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site, four miles from Cranston, was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force.\n",
      "We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties, effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant.\n",
      "The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood.\n",
      "Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis.\n",
      "In addition, land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future.\n",
      "It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island, a non-profit organization, which will reimburse us for the cost of construction.\n",
      "We will then occupy the new plant under lease, with an option to purchase.\n",
      "These arrangements are, in our opinion, very favorable to Leesona.\n",
      "In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant, we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston, and for new machinery, plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt, Limited.\n",
      "We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment.\n",
      "Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000.\n",
      "Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months.\n",
      "In addition, Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations.\n",
      "In addition to direct salaries and wages, the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees:\n",
      "At December 13, 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence, as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan, totaled $2,412,616.\n",
      "The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago.\n",
      "Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living.\n",
      "As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery, Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production, yet maintain both quality and flexibility.\n",
      "The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration.\n",
      "In addition, production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics, as well as blends.\n",
      "Following the term of service in Japan, each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community.\n",
      "the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life.\n",
      "All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify.\n",
      "The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership.\n",
      "In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year, there are concerts by students of the music department, by members of the music faculty, and by visiting artists.\n",
      "These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each;;\n",
      "from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion.\n",
      "Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students.\n",
      "A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures, music, drama, and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n",
      "The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships, to broaden their interests, and to engage in worthwhile service projects.\n"

      "In recent months, much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future.\n",
      "The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing, in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle.\n",
      "This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier, and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level.\n",
      "In the electronics industry, this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets.\n",
      "The total value of our industry's shipments, at factory prices, increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment, military, industrial, and replacement.\n",
      "Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953, dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 1959.\n",
      "set production( excluding those destined for the export market) also ran ahead in the early months, but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic.\n",
      "For the year as a whole, retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959;;\n",
      "however, production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million.\n",
      "In contrast to the lower turnout of TV, total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million( excluding export).\n",
      "Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959.\n",
      "Separate phonographs also had a good year, reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market.\n",
      "The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present, but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods.\n",
      "I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10- 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison, with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will.\n",
      "I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year, but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0- 15.5 million sets.\n",
      "I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million, slightly below 1960, but above 1959.\n",
      "Military electronics to grow\n",
      "1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics, which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959.\n",
      "It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953, which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance.\n",
      "It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's, and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability.\n",
      "While this may well be true in general, I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions.\n",
      "Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially.\n",
      "Research, development test and evaluation funds, devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft, and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963.\n",
      "it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967, and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20%.\n",
      "The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it, and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962.\n",
      "Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual, on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year, to at least $6 billion.\n",
      "Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing, sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959.\n",
      "The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually, reaching some $450 million in 1960.\n",
      "Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's, under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing, industrial process control, and information storage and retrieval.\n",
      "For the near term, however, it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market, and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years;;\n",
      "In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business, the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year.\n",
      "Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half, but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates.\n",
      "In the military field, incoming orders turned down early in the year, and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components.\n",
      "Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million, compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types.\n",
      "Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959, and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961.\n",
      "In sum, I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961, with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion, despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally.\n",
      "As I have indicated above, I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year, but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960;;\n",
      "and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.\n",
      "Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers, working closely with Walter J. Brown, President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary.\n",
      "Mr. Devey's new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague's Special Products Group, which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components, packaged component assemblies, and high temperature magnet wires.\n",
      "Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department, coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D. C., where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies.\n",
      "He was named Product Manager of the Special Products Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958, and was later promoted to his present post.\n",
      "Mr. Brown, well-known, English-born inventor, prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co., Ltd.;;\n",
      "director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain, Ltd., and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co., Cleveland, Ohio.\n",
      "Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923.\n",
      "The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough, Manager of Interference Control Field Service.\n",
      "The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems.\n",
      "Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees, enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course.\n",
      "The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship.\n",
      "The president expects faculty members to remember, in exercising their autonomy, that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions.\n",
      "He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy, but he has a right to expect, in return, that they will leave administrative matters to the administration.\n",
      "How well do faculty members govern themselves??\n",
      "There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government.\n",
      "They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government.\n",
      "They, too, need to learn to delegate.\n",
      "Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole, an area that would benefit by more faculty attention.\n",
      "Although faculties insist on governing themselves, they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government.\n",
      "There are, nevertheless, several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege.\n",
      "He can, for example, present significant university-wide issues to the senate.\n",
      "He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty;;\n",
      "by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments;;\n",
      "The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose.\n",
      "A busy president, conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines, tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is.\n",
      "The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes, but if he looks ahead two, three, or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas, he can open the way for innovation, and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take.\n",
      "Success will require tact, sensitivity to faculty prerogatives, patience, and persistence.\n",
      "The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands.\n",
      "They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas, but they also contribute to top-level decision making.\n",
      "Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration.\n",
      "The administration at the same time, looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments.\n",
      "One way that this can be done, other than by hiring new high-priced professors, is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance.\n",
      "By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards, the president can encourage faculty leadership.\n",
      "Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to.\n",
      "At some colleges and universities, a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates.\n",
      "They can be effective, however, if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work.\n",
      "Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees, the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere.\n",
      "The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind.\n",
      "No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered, although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria.\n",
      "To avoid passing over quiet, unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion, review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments.\n",
      "He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure, to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements.\n",
      "No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different.\n",
      "In particular, the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale.\n",
      "A true university, like most successful marriages, is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern, the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level, which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for.\n",
      "Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals.\n",
      "Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness.\n",
      "More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts.\n",
      "It inspires confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them.\n",
      "A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically, possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer.\n",
      "To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions, a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research.\n",
      "More often, these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data.\n",
      "No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators, budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents.\n",
      "When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget, to which his faith and credit are committed;;\n",
      "He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution.\n",
      "Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship.\n",
      "In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches.\n",
      "Supporting activities -- business management, public relations, fund-raising -- offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education.\n",
      "Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role.\n",
      "In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program, expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention.\n",
      "The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them.\n",
      "Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world, but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income.\n",
      "They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals.\n",
      "A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacities, to make speeches to lay groups, and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus.\n",
      "Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance.\n",
      "By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues, the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution, something more than the lengthened shadow of one man.\n",
      "It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres.\n",
      "When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available, it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon.\n",
      "Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface.\n",
      "The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees.\n",
      "This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet, although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence.\n",
      "For the case of Jupiter, the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components.\n",
      "The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations, but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin.\n",
      "No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported, and, because of their distances, small diameters, or low temperatures, the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity.\n",
      "In spite of this, the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years.\n",
      "They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion;;\n",
      "that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson( 1930) and Pettit( 1935);;\n",
      "and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon, which is again in contrast to the infrared emission, which reaches its maximum at Full Moon.\n",
      "Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves, although opaque to infrared radiation.\n",
      "The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon, while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface, where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase.\n",
      "Since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length, it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material.\n",
      "In the relatively short time since these early observations, Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm, and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 Aj.\n",
      "It should be possible, however, to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers.\n",
      "Recent interferometer measurements( Radhakrishnan and Roberts, 1960) have shown the 960-mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk.\n",
      "Other than this very significant result, most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation.\n",
      "The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets.\n",
      "The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation.\n",
      "The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation, and only if the planet really radiates as a black body, will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material.\n",
      "Therefore, neglecting the extreme outbursts, reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range.\n",
      "Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm, and the results are summarized in Table 1.\n",
      "In the observations at 4.3 mm( Coates, 1959), the diameter of the antenna beam, 6'.7, was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface, and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases.\n",
      "These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions.\n",
      "Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it.\n",
      "The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates( 1959) and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features.\n",
      "Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted.\n",
      "Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19, 1956, using the 50-foot reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington.\n",
      "The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured( Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958), so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known.\n",
      "The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram, to be 0.85.\n",
      "The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly uniform.\n",
      "The result of the observations is Af where the phase angle, Q, is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors.\n",
      "In the discussion which follows, the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component, and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component.\n",
      "Thus, the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc.\n",
      "It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy.\n",
      "The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount.\n",
      "Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities.\n",
      "The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation.\n",
      "In free-burning electric arcs, for instance, approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere.\n",
      "In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode.\n",
      "The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1.\n",
      "Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column.\n",
      "The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af.\n",
      "The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode).\n",
      "It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode.\n",
      "An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must, therefore, aim at a reduction of the anode loss.\n",
      "The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output.\n",
      "Feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode.\n",
      "The third method was, to our knowledge, successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers( Ref. 2).\n",
      "The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage.\n",
      "Gas injection through a porous anode( transpiration cooling) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes, but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself.\n",
      "Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction.\n",
      "Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder.\n",
      "The cathode consisted of a 1/4'''' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube.\n",
      "This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing.\n",
      "The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk.\n",
      "This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode.\n",
      "A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas.\n",
      "It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet.\n",
      "This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection.\n",
      "Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature.\n",
      "To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc, a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder.\n",
      "In addition, the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation.\n",
      "Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug.\n",
      "At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V( peak to peak) with a resistive load.\n",
      "The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders.\n",
      "A high frequency starter was used to start the arc.\n",
      "The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made.\n",
      "In order to reduce the number of variable parameters, all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5'''' and a current of 100 Aj.\n",
      "The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable.\n",
      "The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation: Af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot.\n",
      "Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon, the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as Af.\n",
      "This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.\n",
      "This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned.\n",
      "It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder, to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements.\n",
      "The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry.\n",
      "The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated analogously to equation( 1).\n",
      "There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed.\n",
      "In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks.\n",
      "After it has reached terminal velocity, the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded.\n",
      "The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described.\n",
      "The face of one block contained a hole 1/16'''' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.\n",
      "Although there were only four fluids tested, it was apparent that there were two distinct types.\n",
      "Although the tape was run for over 1 hr., a steady state was not reached, and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate.\n",
      "A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time.\n",
      "By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene( molecular weight reported to be 770) was over half an atmosphere.\n",
      "The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300.\n",
      "These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight.\n",
      "It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly, since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus.\n",
      "This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes.\n",
      "Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies.\n",
      "The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present, and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials.\n",
      "Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks, paints, adhesives, molten plastics, and bread dough, for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length'', `` shortness'', `` spinnability'', etc., which are usually judged by subjective methods at present.\n",
      "Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure, it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects.\n",
      "Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H( referred to the same base as H) and a cross-sectional area of A.\n",
      "Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H.\n",
      "The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af, and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H.\n",
      "The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero.\n",
      "This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields.\n",
      "In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium( referred to by some as thermostatics) to the steady state.\n",
      "This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions''.\n",
      "There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out, and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear, so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar.\n",
      "If the mechanics are similar, we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar.\n",
      "The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear.\n",
      "Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear, and as the rate of shear increases, the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear.\n",
      "According to Philippoff, the recoverable shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of extinction.\n",
      "From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face.\n",
      "There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature, and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields.\n",
      "These droplets appear to be ellipsoids, and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are.\n",
      "Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45-degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear.\n",
      "( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear, and some become asymptotic to it without breakup.\n",
      ") This is, of course, a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies.\n",
      "( D) Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field, it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid.\n",
      "These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear.\n",
      "There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas.\n",
      "If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies, the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis, and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated.\n",
      "This appears to be high, as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops.\n",
      "It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation.\n",
      "In other words, if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature, the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink.\n",
      "This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af.\n",
      "There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af, where **zq is the probability that state( i.e., volume for an ideal gas) could be reached by chance alone.\n",
      "This conformational entropy is, in this case, equal to the usual entropy, for there are no other changes or other energies involved.\n",
      "Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy, the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure.\n",
      "Af is paramagnetic, and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening.\n",
      "An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction.\n",
      "The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af.\n",
      "The experimental second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory.\n",
      "It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure.\n",
      "Af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters, since it is a normal paramagnet, with three unpaired electrons on the chromium, its crystal structure is very simple, and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest.\n",
      "We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment.\n",
      "Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects.\n",
      "Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid.\n",
      "There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric.\n",
      "There is evidence, though less convincing than for Af, that the Af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric.\n",
      "A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A, but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds.\n",
      "There is, then, the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric, although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data.\n",
      "Douglass found Af to be trigonal, Laue symmetry Af, with Af, Af.\n",
      "X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell, corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af.\n",
      "The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group, but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry.\n",
      "This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric.\n",
      "Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af.\n",
      "These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms.\n",
      "The Af layers are stacked normal to the( 111) axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer, in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers.\n",
      "A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6.\n",
      "The structure appears to be unique among OOH compounds, but is the same as that assumed by Af.\n",
      "However, the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af, but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent, with Af at Af and Af at Af( space group Af), where Af represents the oxygens on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side.\n",
      "Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence.\n",
      "The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general, rather than special, positions along the( 111) axis.\n",
      "( 2) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet, but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other;;\n",
      "( 3) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed, either randomly or in an ordered way, so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms.\n",
      "Position( 2) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds.\n",
      "A randomization of `` ups'' and `` downs'' is more likely than ordered `` ups'' and `` downs'' in position( 3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another, and also since ordered `` up'' and `` down'' implies a larger unit cell, for which no evidence exists.\n",
      "Therefore, the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically( 1) or asymmetrically( 3).\n",
      "Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material.\n",
      "This material proved to be unsatisfactory, since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample.\n",
      "Subsequently, we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity.\n",
      "Since Af is ferromagnetic, we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect.\n",
      "The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6%.\n",
      "Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410-degrees-C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor.\n",
      "All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375-degrees-C for one hour.\n",
      "Af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of Af, where Af.\n",
      "Electron microscopic examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter.\n",
      "We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination.\n",
      "The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects.\n",
      "The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal.\n",
      "For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades.\n",
      "The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement( usually about one hour).\n",
      "One sample, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C, showed the presence of adsorbed water( about 0.3 wt)) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared, due to broadening, at low temperature.\n"

      "The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash.\n",
      "As is the case with the surface-active agent, the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high.\n",
      "Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated, but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice.\n",
      "Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present, this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces.\n",
      "The purpose of washing is, obviously, to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below: 1.\n",
      "Dirt, which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties.\n",
      "Miscellaneous soils, which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue.\n",
      "The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent.\n",
      "However, a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of Van der Waal's forces.\n",
      "This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles, or to stick to an uncharged surface.\n",
      "Obviously, if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or, if one kind is charged and the other kind is not, the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced.\n",
      "Likewise, a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa, and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge.\n",
      "The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts, to some extent, as a dissolving and solvating agent.\n",
      "and natural waters, in addition, often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove.\n",
      "The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils.\n",
      "As is well known, detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution.\n",
      "Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants, including the soaps, have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration.\n",
      "( 2) In the critical micelle region, there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles, which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60- 80.\n",
      "( 3) For anionics, these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups( the ionized ends) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase.\n",
      "Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold.\n",
      "Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated, the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process.\n",
      "Related to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil- water interfaces in such a manner that the polar( or ionized) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase.\n",
      "Then during washing, the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass, with the aid of mechanical action, and enter the aqueous phase.\n",
      "Obviously, a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil.\n",
      "Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases.\n",
      "From the equilibrium sorption data which are available, it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt( especially clay soils) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge.\n",
      "This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency.\n",
      "The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale.\n",
      "It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe.\n",
      "Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process, it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic'' properties has gained widespread acceptance.\n",
      "In the over-all process, it is difficult to assign a `` pure'' role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation;;\n",
      "and, indeed, there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active, builder, antiredeposition agent, etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active.\n",
      "Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents, serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction.\n",
      "It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Af radical.\n",
      "The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions.\n",
      "Because of the simplicity of the molecules, isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data.\n",
      "It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals, as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond.\n",
      "It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid.\n",
      "It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine.\n",
      "Furthermore, the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high;;\n",
      "also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for Af radicals.\n",
      "Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish, even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents.\n",
      "We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride.\n",
      "It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation.\n",
      "Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine, the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory.\n",
      "Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place.\n",
      "The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off.\n",
      "The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking, redistributed to the reaction tubes, frozen down, and each tube was then sealed off.\n",
      "The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off.\n",
      "The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing, 5.5 cm. long, diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces.\n",
      "These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride.\n",
      "The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window.\n",
      "The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell.\n",
      "The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts/ minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts/ minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride, empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af.\n",
      "Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent, a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine, to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes.\n",
      "In addition to the method described in the section above, chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a Af eutectic on the vacuum line, and by exchange of Af with molten Af.\n",
      "The reaction rates observed at 200-degrees ranged from Af of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour.\n",
      "Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another, both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour.\n",
      "No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours.\n",
      "Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity.\n",
      "By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases.\n",
      "It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine, and considering the spectral distribution of the light source.\n",
      "These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65-degrees is of the order of magnitude of unity.\n",
      "When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated, chlorine and phosgene were produced.\n",
      "-- Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects, the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate.\n",
      "In series 1, the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm..\n",
      "The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4( 14.7 cm. distance) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity.\n",
      "Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2, where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen.\n",
      "Wyatt and Whipple, 1950), which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation, causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth.\n",
      "Whipple( 1955) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure, which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag.\n",
      "Further, the corpuscular radiation, i.e., the solar-wind protons, must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size, with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force.\n",
      "The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis, with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun.\n",
      "If such is the case, the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have, relative to the Earth, a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth.\n",
      "De Jager( 1955) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect, which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis.\n",
      "This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth.\n",
      "According to Whipple( 1955), cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun, maintaining a fairly steady state.\n",
      "Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material.\n",
      "It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon.\n",
      "In addition, the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain.\n",
      "These vehicles, with large sensitive areas, have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure.\n",
      "Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon, and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude.\n",
      "One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit.\n",
      "There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2, and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable.\n",
      "The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux.\n",
      "Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large.\n",
      "If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements, a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius.\n",
      "With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts, the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones.\n",
      "Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles, a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities.\n",
      "However, one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship.\n",
      "The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor.\n",
      "This `` ejection'' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy.\n",
      "They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus, but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater.\n",
      "There is a difference in the experimental arrangement, in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin.\n",
      "The threshold mass of about Af corresponds to a 10-M-diameter sphere of density Af.\n",
      "However, the conversion from mass to size is unreliable, since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy, loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af.\n",
      "To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown.\n",
      "The velocity value used is also open to some question;;\n",
      "Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket, a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun, as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors.\n",
      "The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity.\n",
      "The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density Af except for the smallest particles, which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure.\n",
      "It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude, in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant.\n",
      "Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used;;\n",
      "The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite, permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known( Cook and Whipple, 1958).\n",
      "A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude( Manning and Eshleman, 1959).\n",
      "The approximate equation is Af, where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af, and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite.\n",
      "Therefore, N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data.\n",
      "The solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns.\n",
      "Also, it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites( Best, 1960), and the same distribution would not be expected.\n",
      "Most meteoritic material, by the time it reaches the Earth's surface, has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere.\n",
      "Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals.\n",
      "Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon.\n",
      "The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect.\n",
      "An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area.\n",
      "Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics.\n",
      "Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques.\n",
      "The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure, through natural respiration, to aerosolized organisms.\n",
      "The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract, such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi, are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence.\n",
      "Very small particles, however, in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs.\n",
      "This area is highly susceptible to infection.\n",
      "The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation.\n",
      "In considering BW defense, it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect.\n",
      "Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface.\n",
      "Certain other properties of small particles, in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract, are noteworthy in defense considerations.\n",
      "From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered.\n",
      "A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns.\n",
      "The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel, cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze.\n",
      "A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first, ninth, and fifteenth floors of a Government office building.\n",
      "This suggests that the sampling period, particularly at the more distant locations, should have been increased.\n",
      "It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered, particularly downwind.\n",
      "This was not, of course, enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol.\n",
      "A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry.\n",
      "Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal.\n",
      "In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure, one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever'' on a finger.\n",
      "An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious.\n",
      "Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever, tularemia, brucellosis, glanders, coccidioidomycosis, etc., belong in this category.\n",
      "An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements.\n",
      "It is, obviously, a proper goal of research to improve on this property.\n",
      "Moreover, it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable.\n",
      "It must be remembered, however, that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent.\n",
      "It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains.\n",

      "Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics.\n",
      "They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics, it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated.\n",
      "They argue further( and somewhat contradictorily) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease.\n",
      "This is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention.\n",
      "This, of course, does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease.\n",
      "Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus( Rickettsia prowazwki) over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom.\n",
      "This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic.\n",
      "On the other hand, a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy.\n",
      "It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons.\n",

      "In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson, and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described.\n",
      "One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube.\n",
      "The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj.\n",
      "For the albumin method, equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin, sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 Aj.\n",
      "Homozygous and heterozygous Af cells, Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample;;\n",
      "The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37-degrees-C before centrifugation.\n",
      "Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum'' type were selected for use in the present study.\n",
      "The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline.\n",
      "Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr, centrifuged and the serum was removed.\n",
      "The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes, approximately 750 ml each, of `` starting buffer''.\n",
      "The chromatography was done at 6-degrees-C using gradient elution, essentially according to Sober and Peterson.\n",
      "When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation, eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above.\n",
      "The unstained strips were then marked, using the stained ones as a guide, and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands.\n",
      "Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, ionic strength 0.154.\n",
      "They were then centrifuged at 59,780 Pm for 35 to 80 min at 20-degrees-C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25%.\n",
      "For preparative ultracentrifugation, fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less, transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline.\n",
      "Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min, refrigeration being used throughout the run.\n",
      "When the early part of the gradient was flattened, either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone-sphere'' gradient to become established more slowly, Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas( donors P. J. and R. S., Fig. 1 and E. M., Fig. 2).\n",
      "The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak( Region 1a) between Regions 1 and 2.\n",
      "There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum, though in two group O donors( J. F. and E. M.) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity( Figs. 1 and 2).\n",

      "Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide.\n",
      "In all cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells, regardless of the type of test( saline, albumin, indirect Coombs) used for comparison.\n",
      "This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera;;\n",

      "Occasionally, you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season, when you are turning over sods in your garden, but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all.\n",
      "They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies, and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt.\n",
      "I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens'', young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn.\n",
      "It is on them alone that the future of their race depends, for all their relatives( mothers, husbands, brothers, and unmated sisters) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather.\n",
      "Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over, falling prey to enemies or disease.\n",
      "The survivors emerge on some nice, sunny day in March or April, when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind.\n",
      "Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest, or otherwise a good sloe tree, or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom, preferably one with male or staminate catkins.\n",
      "It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs, and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green, black-tipped little scale.\n",
      "By scrutinizing the flowers, one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts.\n",
      "a marvelous arrangement, for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread, a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.\n",
      "The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites.\n",
      "Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game, and let us just call them Bombus.\n",
      "If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place, we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep.\n",
      "Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest, a bird house, or the hole made by a woodpecker;;\n",
      "On this, she builds an `` egg compartment'' or `` egg cell'' which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread.\n",
      "The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen, taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots.\n",
      "She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed.\n",
      "After another two weeks, the first young emerge, four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees, collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying.\n",
      "The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones, probably because they are better fed.\n",
      "By the middle of the summer, many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal'', and it is then that young queens begin to appear.\n",
      "The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate, and after a short period of freedom, the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter.\n",
      "It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing, for instance, in August.\n",
      "At the old nest, the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females.\n",
      "The nest itself, the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak, is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths.\n",
      "Some members of the bee family have become idlers, social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives.\n",
      "The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler, Psithyrus, lack the pollen baskets -- naturally!!\n",
      "The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host.\n",
      "When she succeeds, she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively, to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment.\n",
      "The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss, so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally.\n",
      "Worse still, in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills the Bombus queen.\n",
      "But let us return, after this gruesome interlude, to our willow catkins in the spring;;\n",
      "there are other wild bees that command our attention.\n",
      "It is almost certain that some of these, usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees, are andrenas or mining bees.\n",
      "One of my favorites is A. armata, a species very common in England, where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee.\n",
      "The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns, where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds.\n",
      "Almost equal in size to a honeybee, A. armata is much more beautiful in color, at least in the female of the species: a rich, velvety, rusty red.\n",
      "After having mated, an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground, forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil.\n",
      "The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid, so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults.\n",
      "In the Sacramento valley in California, for instance, it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins.\n",
      "This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather, in the plant and the animal.\n",
      "Although Andrena is gregarious, so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together, we must still call it a solitary bee.\n",
      "Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species.\n",
      "On the basis of its life history, we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees.\n",
      "Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job, so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind.\n",
      "Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees.\n",
      "In the United States Department of Agriculture's Yearbook Of Agriculture, 1952, which is devoted entirely to insects, George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females.\n",
      "The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena, but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer, and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage.\n",
      "I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias.\n",
      "This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington, but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August, when the bees are in their most active period.\n",
      "The name `` alkali bee'' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places.\n",
      "The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist;;\n",
      "The best chance, of course, is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry, so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth.\n",
      "Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes, and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes( Thamnophis) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults.\n",
      "Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length'', but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception, with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity.\n",
      "It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity;;\n",
      "Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity, but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions.\n",
      "It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves.\n",
      "There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths, starting with the smallest( boa constrictor) and ending with the largest( anaconda).\n",
      "Data on the former are scanty, but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others, thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does, indeed, attain the greatest length.\n",
      "When it comes to rate of early growth, the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years, more or less.\n",
      "It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently;;\n",
      "it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep.\n",
      "at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet.\n",
      "Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions, it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.\n",
      "It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity, but this apparently is an overestimation.\n",
      "The best way to determine the correct figure( in captives) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth, a method that produced surprising results: maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years, his mate in less than three;;\n",
      "Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity.\n",
      "The following information on snakes varying greatly in size( but all with less than a 10-foot maximum) shows, when considered with the foregoing, that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature.\n",
      "Oliver, in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States, could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers, which I shall consider separately.\n",
      "He concluded that in the southern species, which are rapidly growing types, females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three.\n",
      "Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old, and that the young may be born every other year, rather than annually.\n",
      "Carpenter's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two.\n",
      "Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved, and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions.\n",
      "every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.\n",
      "The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment, but the reason for this is not clear;;\n",
      "There are three levels on which to treat the subject.\n",
      "The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced, sensible conclusion;;\n",
      "The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire.\n",
      "The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes, about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again, or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards;;\n",
      "the mere piling up of testimony does not prove, to the scientific mind, the existence of hoop snakes, joint snakes, or ghosts.\n",
      "Oliver has recently used the second-level approach with the largest snakes, and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet, the reticulate python 33, the African rock python 25, the amethystine python at least 22, the Indian python 20, and the boa constrictor 18-1/2.\n",
      "He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found, some might be 38, and occasional `` monstrous freaks'' over 50.\n",
      "His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength, but these seem to be given to complete his picture, not to be believed.\n",
      "Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows.\n",
      "time required to reach maturity;;\n",
      "A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo, near Chicago, ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 29 inches.\n",
      "Raymond L. Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches.\n",
      "In contrast, Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches, and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces.\n",
      "Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces.\n",
      "Hans Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years, and J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years.\n",
      "It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate.\n",
      "He concluded that the anaconda's maximum length is 12 or 13( perhaps 14) meters, which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet( 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet).\n",
      "However, as a field measurement, it is open to question.\n",
      "It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area.\n",
      "This birth length seems to be typical.\n",
      "The range is from 14 to 25 inches;;\n",
      "final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities.\n",

      "Carl Kauffeld has written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940.\n",
      "One female, collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua, was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long).\n",
      "The female from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long.\n",
      "The results are too varied to allow generalization.\n",
      "The pulmonary vein, however, without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1,, follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship( figs. 8, 22).\n",
      "The pulmonary artery, in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole, the alveolar duct, and the alveoli, continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura( fig. 8).\n",
      "Lung type 3(( fig. 3) is to some degree a composite of types 1, and 2.\n",
      "well defined, but haphazardly arranged, interlobular septa and a thick, remarkably vascular pleura( fig. 9).\n",
      "The most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1,, being composed of numerous, apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional, poorly developed respiratory bronchioles( figs. 14, 15).\n",
      "In this instance, because of incomplete septation, the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1.\n",
      "Air-drifts from one area to another are, therefore, conceivable.\n",
      "Here the pulmonary vein, as in type 2,, is noted to draw away from the bronchus, and to follow a more direct, independent course to the hilum( figs. 23, 24).\n",
      "The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals.\n",
      "As seen in types 1, and 2,, it supplies the hilar lymph nodes, vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein, the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles.\n",
      "As in type 1,, it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa, and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen( figs. 9, 10).\n",
      "Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once.\n",
      "With completion of filling, net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches.\n",
      "The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum( figs. 16, 23, 24).\n",
      "In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery.\n",

      "It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made.\n",
      "and, in contrast, are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent( Van Allen and Lindskog,'31).\n",
      "Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and, if one is permitted to speculate, potential pathology should be included in this statement as well.\n",
      "For example, the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate, long alveolar ducts and short, large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1, and 3.\n",
      "In addition, it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow, considering its marked lobular development but, conversely, not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog.\n",
      "Anatomically, the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man, insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others( Birnbaum,'54) in the human being.\n",
      "The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries.\n",
      "The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller('50).\n",
      "Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals, nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat( Miller,'13;;\n",
      "However, this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung.\n",
      "If this be true, the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema.\n",
      "One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1, or 2.\n",
      "In criticism of the latter's views, his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level.\n",
      "As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein, but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure.\n",
      "It is distinctly possible, therefore, that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence, uninjectable.\n",
      "In addition, little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses.\n",
      "'49) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats.\n",
      "Ellis, Grindlay and Edwards('52) also were unable to find them in rats.\n",
      "Nakamura('58) was unable to demonstrate their existence, either by anatomic or physiologic methods, in dogs.\n",
      "The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred.\n",
      "Certainly, the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species.\n",
      "It is, however, highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species, especially the dog.\n",
      "Also, for the present, great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man.\n",
      "This is especially so if the dog, cat or monkey are to be used, in view of their marked anatomical differences from man.\n",
      "Finally, it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species.\n",

      "In type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed.\n",
      "Well developed respiratory bronchioles, on the other hand, appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2.\n",
      "In type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum.\n",
      "This may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present.\n",
      "In type 3, this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2.\n",
      "The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence.\n",
      "Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early( Table 1), there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets.\n",
      "Third, the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls, a fact which confirms data for other groups of children.\n",
      "The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children.\n",
      "It is convenient to classify a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced'', `` moderate''( modal), or `` delayed'' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` dots'' appeared to the left of, upon, or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line.\n",
      "When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line, the `` moderate'' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age.\n",
      "Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced'' or `` somewhat delayed'', as the case may be, reserving `` moderate'' for dots upon or close to the mean.\n",
      "Second, the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long, short, and round bones of the five regions.\n",
      "The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly, since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region.\n",
      "The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion.\n",
      "It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small, according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body.\n",
      "It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings, but there is substantial agreement.\n",
      "Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth, from Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, or Foot as well as Hand, it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood.\n",
      "It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2.\n",
      "As one approach to doing this, Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2.\n",
      "The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows.\n",
      "Thus, the alignment of the `` dots'' and `` tips'', respectively, indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls.\n",
      "The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset, and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure, or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables.\n",
      "This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1.\n",
      "Thus, the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's ability to `` catch up'' in ossification is demonstrated.\n",
      "The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period.\n",
      "Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1.\n",
      "We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than 1700 values for the entire group -- by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center.\n",
      "Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix.\n",
      "The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix.\n",
      "Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth, dietary patterns, and health during adolescence.\n",
      "The following summary, based on Figures 5 and 6, is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center.\n",
      "At the top of Figure 5, for example, the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1.\n",
      "The correlation( Table 2) between onset age and completion age was -.50, and that between onset age and Span was -.10.\n",
      "Accordingly, girls 31, 29, 33, 21, 26, 13, 3, 4, 14, 32, 24, 25, 34, 23, 6, 15, 22, and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule'' at Onset and Completion.\n",
      "It seems clear, from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls.\n",
      "It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group.\n",
      "In the absence of additions to the homogenate, the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein( Fawcett and Kirkwood, 1953;;\n",
      "This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid, and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems.\n",
      "If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid, large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed( Alexander, 1959).\n",
      "It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism, and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue.\n",
      "On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active iodinating species.\n",
      "In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins( chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.\n",
      "The mono- and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine.\n",
      "There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control.\n",
      "There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination, for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin, a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments( Wolff, Robbins and Rall, 1959).\n",
      "Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine( cf. Section C), it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion.\n",
      "The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from TSH-treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo.\n",
      "There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known.\n",
      "A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates( Alpers, Petermann and Rall, 1956).\n",
      "It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid, where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin.\n",
      "It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine, but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong.\n",
      "It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine-binding proteins, which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine, compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine( Ingbar and Freinkel, 1957).\n",
      "It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such.\n",
      "The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out, but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin( Astwood, 1954).\n",
      "Any of the antithyroid drugs, of either type, if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre, owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, with production of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH, causing the thyroid to enlarge.\n",
      "The effect of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet.\n",
      "It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family.\n",
      "There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre, particularly in Tasmania and Australia( Clements and Wishart, 1956).\n",
      "There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen, which is then secreted in the milk.\n",
      "In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 **ymg per day.\n",
      "With lower levels, thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine.\n",
      "Further, the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally.\n",
      "In the presence of a low iodine intake, thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with Af is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal, the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced.\n",
      "This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin.\n",
      "If the deficiency persists long enough, it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin.\n",
      "Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping, or organification, or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis.\n",
      "The name thyroid-stimulating hormone( TSH) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence.\n",
      "Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood.\n",
      "Brown( 1959) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH, and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject.\n",
      "As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce( 1851) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid.\n",
      "This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith( 1922), who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles.\n",
      "The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later, when Janssen and Loeser( 1931) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities.\n",
      "After their work other investigators applied salt-fractionation techniques to the problem, as well as fractionation with organic solvents, such as acetone.\n",
      "Albert( 1949) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period, from 1931 to 1945, were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material.\n",
      "Developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg( 1958).\n",
      "In the last few years, the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification( Bates and Condliffe, 1960;;\n",
      "The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency, composition and physical properties.\n",
      "First, is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored??\n",
      "It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally.\n",
      "The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients( Adams, 1958).\n",
      "In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood, one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them.\n",
      "The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time.\n",
      "We should like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units.\n",
      "For the most part, this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard.\n",
      "The international unit( u.), adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories( Mussett and Perry, 1955), has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation.\n",
      "Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness, this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups.\n",
      "The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia.\n",
      "Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956, and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis'' suggestive of myelofibrosis.\n",
      "No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July, 1957, in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily.\n",
      "Later, chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure.\n",
      "In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component, triamcinolone, 16 mg. daily, was begun on Sept. 26, 1958, and continued until Feb. 18, 1959.\n",
      "At first the patient felt stronger, and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm., but on Oct. 20, 1958, he complained of `` caving in'' in his knees.\n",
      "By Nov. 8, 1958, weakness, specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature, was pronounced, and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs''.\n",
      "Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter, and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1, 1958, the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse, and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position.\n",
      "At this time a detailed neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in the hands and feet, but marked in the shoulders, hips, and pelvic girdle, with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes.\n",
      "In February, 1959, during the second admission to The New York Hospital, a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections.\n",
      "On Feb. 12, 1959, purified corticotropin( ACTH Gel), 20 units daily intramuscularly, was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention.\n",
      "From March 3 to May 1, 1949, the patient was maintained on dexamethasone, 3 to 6 mg. daily.\n",
      "In spite of normal thyroid function tests, a trial of propylthiouracil, 400 mg. daily for one week, was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness.\n",
      "Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted, as well as fever, malaise, anorexia, anxiety, and an exacerbation of the anemia.\n",
      "A high-protein diet, calcium lactate supplements, and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness.\n",
      "The body was that of a well-developed, somewhat debilitated white man weighing 108 lb..\n",
      "The coronary arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses, and the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin.\n",
      "In addition, other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils.\n",
      "On the surfaces of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter.\n",
      "The gallbladder contained about 40 cc. of green-brown bile and 3 smooth, dark-green calculi measuring up to 1 cm. in diameter.\n",
      "The small and large intestines were filled with gas, and the jejunum was dilated to about 2 times its normal circumference.\n",
      "A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels.\n",
      "The surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear, fluid-filled cysts measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter.\n",
      "On the surface of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow, firm, friable raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter.\n",
      "Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius, pectoralis major, transversus abdominis, biceps brachii, and diaphragm showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers.\n",
      "In the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that shown in Figure 2.\n",
      "In contrast to the nuclear changes described above, another change in muscle nuclei was seen, usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae.\n",
      "Individual nuclei were usually oval to round, though occasionally elongated, and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic.\n",
      "At times, clumps of 10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei were also observed.\n",
      "Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli( Fig. 5).\n",
      "These were thought to represent regenerating fibers.\n",
      "Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles.\n",
      "In attempting to improve specificity of staining, the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways:( 1) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders( Coons, 1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens( E. F. Smith& Townsend) on sweet clover stems.\n",
      "( 2) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20- 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems.\n",
      "The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation with Af.\n",
      "The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al( 1951).\n",
      "Root and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in ice, and cut at 3- 6 **ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees.\n",
      "The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory.\n",
      "After blotting out most of the saline around the sections, a drop of Af was layered over each of the sections, allowed to react for 30 minutes, and then washed with PBS for 15- 30 minutes.\n",
      "After blotting out most of the liquid around the sections, the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine( 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS).\n",
      "As controls, other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus( Wolcyrz and Black, 1956).\n",
      "In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light.\n",
      "However, the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen.\n",
      "Treatment of all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence, especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to 1: 2 with 0.85% saline.\n",
      "In all the above procedures, when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1: 10 or 1: 100 with 0.85% saline, the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced, whereas, a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1: 500 or diluting the Af to 1: 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence.\n",
      "In addition to other treatments, treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering Af did not reduce nonspecific staining.\n",
      "The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and Af, and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained.\n",
      "Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus.\n",
      "After passing Af through DEAE-cellulose, the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1: 4 of the titer before such passage( precipitin ring tests by R. F. Whitcomb);;\n",
      "but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1: 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining.\n",
      "This indicates that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution.\n",
      "Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af, although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography.\n",
      "These areas are thought to represent the nuclei.\n",
      "In the indirect method, this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only.\n",
      "Schramm and Rottger( 1959) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus.\n",
      "The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known.\n",
      "In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.\n",
      "The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cells in the xylem region, but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors.\n",
      "A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "The concentration and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to infect plants.\n",
      "Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man, in addition, by complex symbols, one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex.\n",
      "In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex, the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated.\n",
      "Moreover, the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions.\n",
      "It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned, and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism.\n",
      "MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain( including the hypothalamus) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions.\n",
      "It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception, memory, imagination, and creativity.\n",
      "The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory, but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper.\n",
      "After this brief discussion of neo-, paleocortical, and cortico-hypothalamic relations, let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance.\n",
      "Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges.\n",
      "Consequently, if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level, the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges.\n",
      "It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.\n",
      "Before we comment further on these pathological conditions, we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness.\n",
      "Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep, it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus.\n",
      "Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it, there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance.\n",
      "Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as, for instance, between reserpine and chlorpromazine.\n",
      "Important as these differences are, they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side, we produce depressions, whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and, eventually, maniclike changes.\n",
      "Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges.\n",
      "They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side.\n",
      "This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test.\n",
      "Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl test and, conversely, between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients.\n",
      "The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance, but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states, and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions, additional tests seem to be desirable.\n",
      "It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle.\n",
      "A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or, in special circumstances, to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting.\n",
      "The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic( and also of sympathetic) dominance remain to be elucidated.\n",
      "Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity.\n",
      "A state of parasympathetic `` tuning'' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also to an autonomic reversal: a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response!!\n",
      "Furthermore, conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning'' are observed.\n",
      "It has further been shown that:( 1) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance;;\n",
      "( 3) in a state of depression, the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing( alerting) effect on the Aj.\n",
      "These are few and seemingly disjointed data, but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation, pharmacological action, or clinical processes.\n",
      "The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion.\n",
      "If this is the case, one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise.\n",
      "We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types of personality, but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion( `` abreaction'') may cure a battle neurosis.\n",
      "He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned( conditioned) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed, therefore, that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible.\n",
      "An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means.\n",
      "Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually, it failed to evoke any signs of pain.\n",
      "Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation, Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding.\n",
      "Appropriate experiments showed that this is, indeed, possible.\n",
      "He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses.\n",
      "For the interpretation of these significant investigations, it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions.\n",
      "The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems.\n",
      "The psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in, or based on, this marked difference.\n",
      "In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range, we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems, respectively.\n",
      "We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge.\n",
      "Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems, as a first approximation, it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances, in experimental and clinical neurosis, and as the result of psychopharmacological agents.\n",
      "In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances, it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes.\n",
      "We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V, by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary.\n",

      "this is really a deficiency in the scalar field, namely, that it is not algebraically closed.\n",

      "We have just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent, and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T.\n",
      "Now suppose that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable, N' is nilpotent, and Af.\n",
      "We shall prove that Af.\n",
      "Since D' and N' commute with one another and Af, we see that D' and N' commute with T.\n",
      "for, using the fact that N and N' commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0.\n",
      "if we take Af above, that will be large enough.\n",
      "It then follows that Af is large enough, but this is not obvious from the above expression.\n",
      "Thus we see that Af and Af.\n",
      "From these results, one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators.\n",
      "For vector spaces over non-algebraically closed fields, we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors.\n",
      "It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter.\n",
      "In concluding this section, we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem.\n",
      "We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra.\n",
      "In the primary decomposition theorem, it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional, nor is it necessary for parts( A) and( B) that P be the minimal polynomial for T.\n",
      "If T is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial P such that Af, then parts( A) and( B) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave.\n",
      "If Af is the null space of Af, then Theorem 12 says that Af.\n",
      "Thus, the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af.\n",

      "With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af.\n",
      "We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.\n",
      "In the C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u, V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q.\n",

      "It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.\n",
      "We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.\n",
      "The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1, namely, that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic, and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point.\n",

      "There are three possibilities:( A) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated;;\n",
      "The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.\n",

      "For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even( otherwise, starting in the interior of C, Af could not finally return to the interior), and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function, not a value.\n",
      "Therefore, for any value of T the number of values of f{t} is equal to the( finite) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number.\n",

      "But this is a contradiction, for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T.\n",
      "We have shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval {0,T}, and whose multiplicity is odd.\n",

      "Since the complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines, it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af.\n",
      "The most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q, each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line.\n",
      "Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.\n",
      "It is interesting that a 1: 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils, so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent.\n",

      "This contradicts the preceding observations, and so, under the assumption of this paper, we must reject the possibility that **zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface.\n",

      "We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities, state and provincial governments, rural communities, and other smaller groups, making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected.\n",
      "Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields, showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education, how health affects labor productivity, how small business can benefit the rural farm community, and, above all, how progress in each field relates to national progress.\n",
      "Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development.\n",

      "By holding out prospects for external capital assistance, the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth.\n",
      "At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India, Brazil, the Philippines, and Taiwan, which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth.\n",
      "They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs;;\n",
      "and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups.\n",
      "and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies.\n",
      "On the economic front, the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources.\n",
      "Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved.\n",
      "They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years.\n",
      "Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward.\n",
      "Thus, although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative, and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant, the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.\n",

      "The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West.\n",

      "he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows.\n",
      "Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence.\n",
      "The significant things in it, at the higher religious levels, are the inner emotional, mental, and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation, self-pacification, and self-completion.\n",
      "Related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered, dependable universe.\n",
      "The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides, clarifies, and relates human yearnings, values, ideals, and purposes;;\n",
      "At the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment, it also has great therapeutic value for him.\n",
      "It gives him aid, comfort, even solace, in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate.\n",
      "He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie.\n",
      "His religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern, and his religious faith makes possible fortitude, equanimity, and consolation, enabling him to endure colossal misfortune, fear, frustration, uncertainty, suffering, evil, and danger.\n",
      "The feeling of individual inferiority, defeat, or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly, but all-victorious Father-God, as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith, and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.\n",
      "In addition to the functions of religion within man, there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society.\n",
      "The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with, and to a degree dependent upon, a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions.\n",
      "for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism.\n",
      "Furthermore, religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values;;\n",
      "Finally, it gives sanctity, more than human legitimacy, and even, through super-empirical reference, transcendent and supernatural importance to some values;;\n",
      "Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society, which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends.\n",
      "This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends;;\n",
      "for example, a plan that fulfills the will of God, which advances the Kingdom of God, which involves social life as part of the Grand Design.\n",
      "Finally, it gives meaning to much social endeavor, and logic, consistency, and meaning to life.\n",
      "In general, there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends.\n",
      "These groups have varied widely from mere families, primitive, totemic groups, and small modern cults and sects, to the memberships of great denominations, and great, widely dispersed world religions.\n",
      "it enables members of the society to operate as a system.\n",
      "The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine;;\n",
      "Durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them''.\n",
      "His view is that every religion pertains to a community, and, conversely, every community is in one aspect a religious unit.\n",
      "This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States;;\n",
      "The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units, with religion as the dominant bond, even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized.\n",
      "It might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion, for good or ill, has often supported or been identified with other groupings -- political, nationality, language, class, racial, sociability, even economic.\n",
      "There is a marked tendency for religions, once firmly established, to resist change, not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices, but also in secular affairs having religious relevance.\n",
      "It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values, though also in some measure, an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones.\n",
      "It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments, the traditional ways of thinking, and the customary ways of living.\n",
      "As Yinger has pointed out, the `` reliance on symbols, on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values, turns one to the past far more than to the future''.\n",
      "At the same time that religion exercises a conserving influence, it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups.\n",
      "Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives.\n",
      "The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force, mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices;;\n",
      "Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion.\n",
      "The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects.\n",
      "Religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now.\n",
      "Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income, her defense of denial was excessively strong.\n",
      "The result, dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning, was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin, whose birth had not been anticipated.\n",
      "Soon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family.\n",
      "Inability to care for the other children, difficulty in feeding the babies, who seemed colicky, bone-weary fatigue, repeated crying episodes, and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation.\n",
      "Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight, as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying.\n",
      "In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins.\n",
      "Simultaneously, a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too motherly homemaker, referral for temporary economic aid, intelligent use of nursing care, accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms.\n",
      "Follow-up visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's day-to-day mental health and social functioning.\n",
      "As seen in the B. family, there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem, especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance.\n",
      "The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference.\n",
      "While some regression is inevitable, it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy.\n",
      "In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem.\n",
      "In so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact.\n",
      "Thus, the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf.\n",
      "Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation.\n",
      "Over a relatively short period of time, usually about four to twelve weeks, the worker must be able to shift the focus, back and forth, between immediate external stressful exigencies( `` precipitating stress'') and the key, emotionally relevant issues( `` underlying problem'') which are, often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough, reactivated by the crisis situation, and hence once again amenable to resolution.\n",
      "Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques, they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments.\n",
      "Then, too, the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits, single and group office interviews, and appropriate telephone follow-up calls, if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention.\n",
      "In addition, in many cases, a variety of concrete social resources -- homemaker, day care, medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts.\n",
      "At certain critical stages, and only for sound diagnostic reasons, it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating.\n",
      "While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker( in terms of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client's life), techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives.\n",
      "Finally, whatever the techniques used, a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.\n",
      "Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework, we now address ourselves to our final question: What place should brief, crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services??\n",
      "We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values, locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top, instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum, each important in its own right.\n",
      "Almost three decades ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services.\n",
      "Thus, casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended.\n",
      "Especially noteworthy is Levinger's finding that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome.\n",
      "According to a number of studies, the important predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping person.\n",
      "For example, the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project.\n",
      "Of startling significance, too, is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services.\n",
      "These reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people.\n",
      "Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship, quick appraisal of key issues, and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses.\n",
      "While there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention, the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's initial need for help.\n",
      "Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening, the worker can withdraw) is another prominent feature in these efforts.\n",
      "My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy'' but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess, and to use them with greater confidence, precision, and professional pride.\n",
      "Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps, in some instances, primary -- level, the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings.\n",
      "Moreover, the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people.\n",
      "Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures, crisis problems, reaction mechanisms, and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners.\n",
      "Our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian.\n",
      "Probably, in the immediate future, we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models.\n",
      "Increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies, especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services, holds rich promise for the future.\n",
      "It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society.\n",
      "As Loomis remarks, `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking, friendship, and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations''.\n",
      "Maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today.\n",
      "Yet, the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war.\n",
      "Prior to World War 2, there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World War 2.\n",
      "The norms, as elements, refer to `` all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system''.\n",
      "The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements.\n",
      "From the evidence `` it may be conjectured that core- core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females;;\n",
      "The element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them.\n",
      "There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power, primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power, has been exerted on actors in the system, particularly in regard to mate selection.\n",
      "This would seem to vary from family to family, depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status'' of that family.\n",
      "Interviews with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population.\n",
      "Despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages, the population has been able to sustain, at least to some degree, the consciousness of its intermediate status in society.\n",
      "The adherence of many in the population to the Indian background in their pedigree, and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves, becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society.\n",
      "The negative sanctions applied to core- Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms.\n",
      "However, because of Church laws, lately more stringently enforced, which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously, a means of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions.\n",
      "A cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship.\n",
      "There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group.\n",
      "Additionally, the proscription of core- Negro marriages for core families, discussed above, would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles.\n",
      "However, it cannot be presumed, informal though the structure of the population seems, that there are not well-defined roles within the system.\n",
      "The present study relates to the theory of functional systems.\n",
      "It is hypothesized that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is considered.\n",
      "The four functional problems of a social system are, to some extent, solved by the subsystems within this population.\n",
      "In order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension, the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection, and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls.\n",
      "To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society, it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible'', but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate, distinct grouping or system in society.\n",
      "Adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation.\n",
      "Integration `` has to do with the inter-relation of parts''.\n",
      "Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration, the higher the morale and solidarity, the better the system can solve the problems of the system.\n",
      "In this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general locality, the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population.\n",
      "It is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation.\n",
      "Institutionalization Though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its subsystems, two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular emphasis.\n",
      "Urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group.\n",
      "A more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe area are, in general, less segregated locally than group members in rural areas.\n",
      "In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous, resulting in a change of values and, almost necessarily, in mate selection behavior.\n",
      "To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation, to that extent it contributes directly to increased exogamy''.\n",
      "The process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual's behavior, as well as the group's behavior.\n",
      "Examples from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group.\n",
      "There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society.\n",
      "`` Culturally induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values internalized by members of the group'' is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of socialization.\n",
      "The fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function, though a latent one, of the process of maintaining the boundary.\n",
      "`` Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved, for example, by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern.\n",
      "'' The external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment.\n",
      "'' Boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social, as is the preference for endogamy.\n",
      "By their pattern of endogamy and exogamy, the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain.\n",
      "Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group, systemic linkage is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit.\n",
      "But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors.\n",
      "A unified set of regulations, applicable to all areas, was issued in 1929, and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time.\n",
      "The district officials, along with their other duties, were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics.\n",
      "Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned, including his or her date of birth( or age at a specified time), spouses, and children.\n",
      "Additional entries must be made from time to time.\n",
      "Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments, inoculations, periods of employment, and changes of residence are recorded.\n",
      "Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females.\n",
      "The cards of permanent out-migrants are, in theory, sent to an office in the place of new residence.\n",
      "The results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts, including birth and death rates, general fertility rates, distributions by marital status, fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households, infant mortality, and migration.\n",
      "The areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials, supposedly as representative of a larger population.\n",
      "Averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population.\n",
      "The scheme, in theory, is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life.\n",
      "The system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers.\n",
      "So the results are subject to considerable confusion.\n",
      "The system tended to break down during the war, but was reactivated;;\n",
      "In spite of the defects in this system, the figures on total population during the late 1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity.\n",
      "Here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods.\n",
      "The work of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance Medicale aux Indigenes Du Congo Belge( FOREAMI) has special interest with respect to demography.\n",
      "This agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the Kwango District and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville.\n",
      "Each year from 1941 on, its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and, as its primary objective, the incidence of major diseases.\n",
      "Other independent, or partially independent agencies, have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography.\n",
      "A Bureau De La Demographie( A. Romaniuk, Director) was formed under AIMO in the Congo, to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique of the Secretariat General.\n",
      "Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office.\n",
      "A member of the IRSAC staff( E. Van De Walle) was recently delegated to cooperate with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in this territory.\n",
      "Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators( three teams, each working in two provinces).\n",
      "Sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory, so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits.\n",
      "These changes represent, in effect, a shift from( 1) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to( 2) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population.\n",
      "It also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future).\n",
      "It is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years, though the value of these estimates is open to question.\n",
      "Furthermore, it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method( as distinguished from sampling error) in each of these sources, on such subjects as fertility, mortality, and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.\n",
      "It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960, so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more expeditiously.\n",

      "He found, as he had suspected, a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students.\n",
      "However, all admitted that the `` hindsight'' was not altogether lost.\n",
      "In their own words, it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages, and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time.\n",
      "In fact, they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be, at the beginning, some `` hindsight'' study;;\n",
      "but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent.\n",
      "All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course.\n",
      "As one of them expressed it, `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these not-yet-married people.\n",
      "Had I been in an all-married section I would have missed this, and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me''.\n",
      "This comment and others similar to it, would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status quo.\n",
      "Thus, the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is, prerequisite: `` marriage''.\n",
      "This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed'' sections, and some of them, largely because of scheduling difficulties, did.\n",
      "This action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores.\n",
      "Many of them appear to drop out, for one reason or another.\n",
      "By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it.\n",
      "The philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively.\n",
      "For no particular reason, other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both mates to be in attendance.\n",
      "Incidentally, it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week, until at last it swelled to such proportions that this `` free'' auditing policy had to be retracted.\n",
      "After that, we began to get `` visitors'' to class.\n",
      "It ranged from a freshman woman, just married, through the various academic growth stages, including one senior-graduate student, to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended.\n",
      "It ranged from those with no children, through students in various stages of pregnancy, to one 44-year-old male with four children, three of whom were teenagers.\n",
      "It ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive.\n",
      "One might digress at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise'' to create special sections for special status, then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage, and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children, and so on.\n",
      "But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation.\n",
      "He made it clear from the beginning that this was the students' opportunity, and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one.\n",
      "This is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods, nor a course in how to raise children.\n",
      "But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible.\n",
      "A steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was taking.\n",
      "Since they are all either rented or borrowed, the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance.\n",
      "The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be.\n",
      "For example, the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched.\n",
      "Since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after, of course, pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one.\n",
      "Though it did not become known to the writer for some time, a nucleus group had sprung up within the class.\n",
      "They began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class.\n",
      "From a few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class, and many outsiders as well.\n",
      "Also, although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning, most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class.\n",
      "In fact, they often revamped their social activities to include class members previously unknown.\n",
      "Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections, the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group.\n",
      "These students, although they might read various articles in popular magazines, more often chose to report on articles found in the journals.\n",
      "In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles, there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read.\n",
      "Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction, the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest.\n",
      "Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment, nor, as a matter of fact, in those who were continuing in `` single sections'', he can only conclude that there must have been something `` contagious'' within the specific group which caused this to occur.\n",
      "This was not a search for a `` magic formula'', but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage.\n",
      "In short, it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy.\n",
      "Not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to( 2), Specific adjustment areas, such as sex, in-laws, religion, finance, and so on.\n",
      "From here they proceeded to( 3) These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages, developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other.\n",
      "This was not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen.\n",
      "But just when was an unknown, and of course the longer it did not happen, the stronger her wish and belief that it might not.\n",
      "Since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis.\n",
      "This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation.\n",
      "Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening.\n",
      "He felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm, as a criterion, is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think.\n",
      "On the other hand, the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with love as most women seem to do.\n",
      "In the reproductive area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed'' marital status sections.\n",
      "Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent.\n",
      "There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented, from a childless couple to and including every trimester.\n",
      "In fact, we had one birth before the end of the course, and another student had to take the final examiantion a week early, just to be on the safe side.\n",
      "Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring'' experience.\n",
      "It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal, concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like'' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances.\n",
      "Some predictions had been made concerning factors R, N, I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity.\n"

      "It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` Inferiority'' factor.\n",
      "Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study.\n",
      "There were 24%( 10 subjects) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction.\n",
      "One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax.\n",
      "Five subjects( 12%) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm, what that something was, and also were given a demonstration.\n",
      "Four subjects( 10%) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not.\n",
      "At no time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject's initial reaction was deviant.\n",
      "Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion.\n",
      "This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it.\n",
      "These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried.\n",
      "In no way, either verbally or behaviorally, did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction.\n",
      "Moreover, when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed, the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation.\n",
      "They continued to give an arm-elevation.\n",
      "A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion.\n",
      "Autosuggestibility, the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome( i.e., that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction, because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction'') also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons:( 1) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose, and( 2) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening( e.g., of becoming dizzy and maybe falling, an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects).\n",
      "While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had, they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had.\n",
      "There was no implication made that their initial reaction( absence of an arm-elevation) was less preferred than the presence of levitation.\n",
      "A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax, since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as `` normal''.\n",
      "They were not free to be themselves in this situation, an interpersonal one, where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior.\n",
      "Instructions to relax, i.e., to be `` spontaneous'', and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have, was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given.\n",
      "While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity, it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior.\n",
      "Alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject( the only one with whom this technique was tried).\n",
      "There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement.\n",
      "She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls.\n",
      "Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it.\n",
      "These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had.\n",
      "They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction.\n",
      "Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily.\n",
      "One subject spontaneously asked( after her arm had finally risen), `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before''??\n",
      "Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it;;\n",
      "I thought it wasn't supposed to''.\n",
      "She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial, but had consciously prevented it from so doing.\n",
      "She explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax''.\n",
      "When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up, she commented, `` I don't see how they can prevent it''.\n",
      "In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects, the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity.\n",
      "They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level.\n",
      "The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects;;\n",
      "but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation.\n",
      "One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows: `` You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen''.\n",
      "However, she was able to relax and yield to the moment.\n",
      "It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects;;\n",
      "that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors.\n",
      "It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below.\n",
      "Thus, this readiness to relax controls, evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation, appears to be a more general personality factor.\n",
      "The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world.\n",
      "This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill.\n",
      "They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses.\n",
      "Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be.\n",
      "The change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects, after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions, suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations.\n",
      "They were able to experience at first, in terms of past conventionality.\n",
      "When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions, they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present.\n",
      "It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong;;\n",
      "that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening'' until they are tested and proved otherwise.\n",
      "While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only, they gain support from such comments as the following, which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not, on the first trial, perceive the tilt illusion.\n",
      "It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method.\n",
      "The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community, predominantly middle- to upper-middle class, but fringed by an industrial area.\n",
      "In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status, we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods.\n",
      "Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement.\n",
      "The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores.\n",
      "It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation.\n",
      "The parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others, irrational conformity to rules, orderliness, punctuality, and need for certainty.\n",
      "The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and, as much as possible, to record the parents' actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations.\n",
      "The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records, categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity, then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records.\n",
      "Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms.\n",
      "Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations, or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals.\n",
      "But she cleans it up very well when I remind her''.\n",
      "There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees.\n",
      "Reliability and validation work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda, et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale.\n",
      "Relationship of Anxiety to compulsivity\n",
      "In theory, compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety, and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer.\n",
      "In the primary grades, reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress, and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years.\n",
      "In establishing criterion measurements, it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself.\n",
      "The Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker.\n",
      "The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact( in this case, Af);;\n",
      "therefore, in the investigation of the present hypothesis, it was necessary to control this factor.\n",
      "It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q..\n",
      "For example, on the basis of the regression equation, a child with an I.Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8( grade equivalent).\n",
      "A child with an I.Q. of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5.\n",
      "In this manner, the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled, allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables.\n",
      "It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools, the high compulsive children do better( Af).\n",
      "While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured, we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives.\n",
      "We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting, but that their need to organize( for comfort) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment.\n",
      "It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores( although not significantly lower).\n",
      "Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure.\n",
      "Our conjecture is, then, that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught, the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work.\n",
      "The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4.\n",
      "While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well( Af) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children, they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom.\n",
      "According to the theory proposed, this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment.\n",
      "The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit.\n",
      "The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement, but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols, the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem.\n",
      "Failure confirms the threat, and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult, so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced.\n",
      "But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple.\n",
      "Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked.\n",
      "Sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation, and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher.\n",
      "Observers, in the two school systems studied here, judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding, while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting.\n",
      "Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school, and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting.\n",
      "Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts.\n",
      "Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals.\n",
      "Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose: to evaluate procedures, regardless of individuals.\n",
      "One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas.\n",
      "Interviewing, checking references, training the salesmen, having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high.\n",
      "It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed.\n",
      "Roleplaying was offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room, where the president explained the difficulty he had, and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out.\n",
      "In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires, checking their references, interviewing them, asking them to be tried out, he told them he would prefer to test them.\n",
      "Each person was to enter the testing room, carrying a suitcase of samples.\n",
      "Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product.\n",
      "In the testing room he was to make, successively, three presentations to three different people.\n",
      "Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it.\n",
      "The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three.\n",
      "The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work'' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different, but typical restaurant owners and managers.\n",
      "From the point of view of the applicants, less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances.\n",
      "The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions.\n",
      "At the end of work one day, the personnel man took the applicants one at a time, asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes.\n",
      "Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl, whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time, did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist, showing wit, sparkle, and aplomb.\n",
      "She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day.\n",
      "The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm, was well trained, was considered a hard worker, was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` comer''.\n",
      "However, he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position.\n",
      "He seemed to antagonize everyone.\n",
      "Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer, he seemed to be a very poor administrator, although no one quite knew what was wrong with him.\n",
      "At the insistence of his own supervisor -- the president of the firm -- he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders.\n",
      "He played a number of typical situations before observers, other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong.\n",
      "Entirely concerned with efficiency, he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes, condemning them to too great an extent.\n",
      "He did not really listen to others, had little interest in their ideas, and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way.\n",
      "The entire group of managers explained, in great detail, a number of human relations errors that he made.\n",
      "He refused to change his approach, and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not backing him, and subordinates for their laxness, stupidity, and stubbornness.\n",
      "After the diagnosing, he left the course, convinced that it could do him no good.\n",
      "We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment.\n",
      "The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it.\n",
      "We may say that his attitude was foolish, since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills;;\n",
      "or we may say that his attitude was commendable, showing his independence of mind, in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others.\n",
      "In any case, he refused to accept the implications of the analysis, that he needed to be made over.\n",
      "In a course for supermarket operators, a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager, found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time.\n",
      "He was told he displayed, for example, a sense of superiority -- and he answered: `` Well, I am supposed to know all the answers, aren't I''??\n",
      "He was criticized for his curtness and abruptness -- and he answered: `` I am not working to become popular''.\n",
      "On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered: `` I have to make decisions.\n",
      "However, in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways.\n",
      "The director helped tailor-make a check list of the district manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made.\n",
      "Eighteen errors were located, and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors.\n",

      "The first eight of these eighteen statements, which received at least one-half of the votes, were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager, and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations, the members checked any items that appeared.\n",
      "To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions, they were rather lengthy( about twenty minutes), the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect, new antagonists were brought on the scene unexpectedly, and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized.\n",

      "One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion, during which, despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks, I felt only a cold annoyance with her.\n",
      "Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me, this time, what Granny was like;;\n",
      "At another phase in the therapy, when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene, she muttered in a low but intense voice, to herself, `` I hate that woman inside me''!!\n",
      "Again, I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication, and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak, with such utter conviction, of an opinion held by my father, now several years deceased.\n",
      "She looked confused at this, and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make.\n",
      "It then occurred to me to ask, `` Is that what that woman told you''??\n",
      "She clearly agreed that this had been the case.\n",
      "I realized, now, that she had been showing me, in what impressed me as being a very accurate way, something her mother had once said to her;;\n",
      "it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her.\n",
      "What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now, despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me, sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.\n",
      "Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room, as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice.\n",
      "A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine, who used to often seclude herself in her room, often sounded through the closed door -- as I would find on passing by, between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons, a scolding mother and a defensive child.\n",
      "Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist, some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware, and the recognition of which, as a part of himself, he finds distinctly unwelcome.\n",
      "I have found, time and again, that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests, in the final analysis, on this basis;;\n",
      "and only when I can acknowledge this, to myself, as being indeed an aspect of my personality, does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior.\n",
      "For example, one hebephrenic man used to annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day, or whenever, `` You're welcome'', in a notably condescending fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, `` thank you'' to him at the end of each session.\n",
      "Eventually it became clear to me, partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly, that this man, with his condescending, `` You're welcome'', was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor, over these months, on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note, each time, that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow.\n",
      "Another patient, a paranoid woman, for many months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building, as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met.\n",
      "This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between, on the one hand, her arranging the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking, or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others, and on the other hand, my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections, bringing my big easy chair with me, usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state, and plunking myself down in my chair -- in short, behaving as if I owned her room.\n",
      "Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated, or reduced, in their communicative expression, to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement.\n",
      "One finds, for example, that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression, seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention, reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings, and the most unconventional of meanings.\n",
      "More than anything, it is the therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed, something like a spread-out deck of cards, on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together.\n",
      "One cannot assume, of course, that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy, or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered;;\n",
      "probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well-grooved, stereotyped mode of expression -- and no, or but a few, other communicational grooves, as yet -- being there, available for the patient's use, as newly-emerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months.\n",
      "But it is true that the therapist can sense, when he hears this stereotype, that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it, a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another.\n",
      "Or an `` I want to go home'', or whatever -- but a nonverbal one which reveals itself, gradually, as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning.\n",
      "A hebephrenic man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely-silent hours with his therapist.\n",
      "When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him, `` What is that, Bill -- hello or farewell''??\n",
      "Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression, that which seems best to give release, and communicational expression, to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter.\n",
      "It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient, the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic symptoms, laughter -- laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping, or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair;;\n",
      "in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch, or the passage of flatus, not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze, but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute forms of communication in which, from time to time, quite different things are being said, long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these, as distinct feelings and concepts, to say them in words.\n",
      "this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are, at an unconscious level, well sorted out, but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which, even in the unconscious, have yet to become well differentiated from one another.\n",
      "Freeman, Cameron and McGhie, in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients, say, in regard to condensation, that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment, and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation''.\n",
      "In my experience, a great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience.\n",
      "Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing, or incident, in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding, hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene.\n",
      "Recently, for example, a paranoid woman's large-scale philosophizing, in the session, about the intrusive curiosity which has become, in her opinion, a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture, developed itself, before the end of the session, into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast, as indeed I was.\n",
      "One hebephrenic women confided to me, `` I live in a world of words'', as if, to her, words were fully concrete objects;;\n",
      "A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding, in a most articulate fashion, during session after session with me, were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him;;\n",
      "The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes, stems, suffixes, etc..\n",
      "This approach requires that:( 1) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries, and( 2) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word.\n",
      "The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file.\n",
      "We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem.\n",
      "But first, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood: form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space;;\n",
      "We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text.\n",
      "A random-storage scheme, based on the spelling of forms, provides an economical way to compile this text-form list.\n",
      "Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked.\n",
      "The dictionary is a form dictionary, at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries.\n",
      "Also, the dictionary is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms.\n",
      "The first is compiling a list of text forms, assigning an information cell to each, and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence.\n",
      "The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af;;\n",
      "the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence.\n",
      "Let us assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text.\n",
      "If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af, the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af.\n",
      "When, as in this case, the two forms match, the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af.\n",
      "Thus, when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region, a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms, one cell in the chain for each form.\n",
      "If Af leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af, even though Af does not match Af, the chain of information cells is extended from Af by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region, Af, in Af.\n",
      "Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored.\n",
      "Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain;;\n",
      "Hence, when the address Af is computed from Af, the cell Af and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain.\n",
      "This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms.\n",
      "These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage.\n",
      "The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time.\n",
      "Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading.\n",
      "A random address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form.\n",
      "If cell Af is an information cell, it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored.\n",
      "If cell Af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list.\n",
      "The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list, and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text.\n",
      "The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis.\n",
      "A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence.\n",
      "The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe.\n",
      "When entries are being retrieved from this file, the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer.\n",
      "Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj.\n",
      "the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents.\n",
      "The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms.\n",
      "( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it.\n",
      "Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form.\n",
      "The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage.\n",
      "The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word, hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents.\n",
      "Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification, we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once.\n",
      "Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context.\n",
      "For example, the inflected forms of a word can be represented, insofar as regular inflection allows, by a stem and a set of endings to be attached.\n",
      ") The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list.\n",
      "Similarly, if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary, the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form.\n",

      "If, as I suspect, the problem is largely of the second sort, then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.\n",
      "One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems.\n",
      "Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis.\n",
      "The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features.\n",
      "Pitch differences from one speaker to another, or from one emotional state to another, may far exceed the small differences between tones.\n",

      "In some( the Ewe type mentioned above) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans.\n",
      "While the phonemes can be very easily stated, no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units, i.e. until the morphophonemics is worked out, or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success.\n",
      "Often, therefore, there are a number of rules having the same effect, and commonly other sets of rules as well, having the opposite effect.\n",
      "Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics, even when the total number of rules is no greater.\n",
      "This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis, as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems.\n",
      "A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics, but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics.\n",
      "And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least, the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures.\n",
      "There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance.\n",

      "This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw.\n",
      "It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms.\n",
      "The treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex, largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point.\n",
      "There are more stems per item in Athabascan, which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts.\n",
      "The differentiation, however, is not very much greater, as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts, with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample: 24 as against 21.\n",
      ") These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison.\n",
      "The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used.\n",
      "These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself, within a compact and uniform territorial area, but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined.\n",
      "Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal;;\n",
      "I, one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley.\n",
      "The result is that I included 70 animal names, but Swadesh only 4;;\n",
      "Swadesh, and therefore Hoijer, felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera( ox, vulture, salmon, yellow pine, manzanita);;\n",
      "their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts( fish, bird, tree, grass, horn, tail, bark, root).\n",
      "The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size.\n",
      "It will be seen that where the scope is similar, the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4: 5) except for verbs, where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower.\n",
      "Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb.\n",
      "If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot, it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually.\n",
      "the three others had to be spread somewhat, and are headed respectively Af;;\n",
      "The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation, it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement.\n",
      "Thomas' findings are, first, `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence'';;\n",
      "but, second, `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence''( as between M-K and I-E).\n",
      "His formula will have to be weighed, may be altered or improved, and it should be tested on additional bodies of material.\n",
      "But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance;;\n",
      "As to relative frequencies of competing roots( 7- 1 vs. 4- 4, etc.), Thomas with his' weighting' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have.\n",
      "I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication, in which, in listing' Two-Stem Meanings', I set off by asterisks those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem A/3, the unasterisked ones standing for Af;;\n",
      "If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems, as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world, why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms, but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly??\n",
      "It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items.\n",
      "Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list??\n",
      "It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible.\n",
      "And why that insistence??\n",
      "But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare.\n",
      "Not that such a list cannot be constructed;;\n",
      "but the nearer it comes to attaining universality, the less significant will it be linguistically.\n",
      "Its terms will tend to be labile or vague, and they will fit actual languages more and more badly.\n",
      "The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible.\n",
      "and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities.\n",
      "Some of this may prove to be true, or even considerable of it, whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence.\n",
      "But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links;;\n",
      "of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan, in Yokuts, in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them.\n",
      "This involves step-by-step progress, and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry.\n",
      "If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding, and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding, that is no reason why we should swerve.\n",
      "It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble, solid, and limited basis.\n",
      "There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable.\n",
      "An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected.\n",
      "Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies.\n",
      "It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany, with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies, and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other.\n",
      "When the Yalta Conference opened, the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down.\n",
      "Starting in great force late in December, from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest, the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder, thirty miles from Berlin, and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun, while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine.\n",
      "The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage.\n",
      "The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line, which was substantially Russia's 1941 border, as the boundary between Russia and Poland.\n",
      "He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.\n",
      "The bitter memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference and of the West's effort to stamp out Bolshevism at its birth boiled up within him.\n",
      "The White Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and Molotov were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and Clemenceau.\n",
      "Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions.\n",
      "He did not mind the Line itself, which Churchill declared in the House of Commons, on February 27, 1945, he had always believed to be `` just and right'', but he did not want it called by a hated name.\n",
      "The West had long since forgotten the events of 1919, but it was not so easy for the Red leaders, who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period.\n",
      "In the Dunn-Atherton memorandum of February 4, 1942, the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries.\n",
      "Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move Poland's western borders deep into Germany, back to the western Neisse-Oder River lines, taking not only East Prussia and all of Silesia but Pomerania and the tip of Brandenburg, back to and including Stettin.\n",
      "From six to nine million additional Germans would be evicted, though most would have fled, and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor territories, including the great Pripet Marshes, which she lost to Russia.\n",
      "Stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer, `` although it costs us blood'', in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the Germans.\n",
      "He would tell the Poles, he said, that they had been `` given a fine place to live in, more than three hundred miles each way''.\n",
      "At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave, trying to find work in Germany, and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south, instead of the Eastern Neisse, both of which flow into the Oder.\n",
      "The moving of millions of the German master-race, from the very heart of Junkerdom, to make room for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation, but there was little doubt that it was historically justified.\n",
      "Of more importance to the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government.\n",
      "At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit, in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies.\n",
      "Though little democracy had ever been practised in this region, and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means, it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it.\n",
      "Believing devoutly as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions, it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them.\n",
      "More time was spent in trying to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discussed at Yalta.\n",
      "The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be `` reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the Poles abroad'', and pledged to hold `` free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot''.\n",
      "All `` democratic and anti-Nazi parties'' were to have the right to campaign.\n",
      "It is in Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful, in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force.\n",
      "It is necessary that Poland should be free, independent in power.\n",
      "In other words, the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the Soviets or posing as an independent, balancing power in between Russia and Germany.\n",
      "Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland.\n",
      "Any free elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which Moscow had complete confidence, and all pressure from the West for free voting by anti-Soviet elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements.\n",
      "In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe, where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the Nazis, even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into Russia as a part of Hitler's armies.\n",
      "But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice''.\n",
      "In any case `` here in their judgment conditions require''( italics added) they would `` form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people''.\n",
      "Other similar affirmations in the Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model.\n",
      "Later it developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy, which will be discussed later, and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions, as we understand them, within their zone of influence.\n",
      "Professor McNeill thinks that at Yalta, Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him, that he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters from East European elections would not be greatly resented by his allies, while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced `` the fact that, in Poland at least, genuinely free democratic elections would return governments unfriendly to Russia'', by any definition of international friendliness.\n",
      "Also war-time propaganda and cooperation had `` obscured the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy'', and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil the military victories over Germany and Japan.\n",
      "The application of these formulae could not please both sides, for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable.\n",
      "While obliged to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it, we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe.\n",
      "This illusion was described in a far-sighted editorial in The New York Herald Tribune, on March 5, 1947, in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaties to the Senate.\n",
      "Yalta left us with comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic political economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of Bessarabia''( Italics added)\n",
      "This is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion, which applied to other areas than East Europe.\n",
      "The same editorial continued that `` We expected to democratize Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions.\n",
      "We expected, in short, that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple, from such a position, to deal with the localized aberrations of the Soviet Union''.\n",
      "Yet actually `` the image corresponded in no way to the actualities of the post-war world.\n",
      "Neither our military, our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough'' to determine the fate of East Europe.\n",
      "Here is the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written.\n",
      "Failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite treaties, President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March 12, 1947, in the Truman Doctrine, exactly one week after the Herald Tribune editorial was written, and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at Fulton, Missouri, in Truman's presence.\n",
      "Then China promptly went Communist, and Mr. Truman had to fight the interminable Korean war for the democratization of Korea before we learned how far our writ did `` reach in Asia''.\n",
      "of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War 2, -- Communist control of East Europe and China -- a new balance of power.\n",
      "While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta.\n",
      "Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes.\n",
      "All political interests supported electoral planning, although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination.\n",
      "A third aspect, and probably the one open to most controversy, is the results of the election.\n",
      "The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics.\n",
      "King Muhammad 5, was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day, 1957.\n",
      "There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957, in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic.\n",
      "From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics, precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government.\n",
      "Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958, there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes.\n",
      "The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957, but the P.D.I.( Parti Democratique de l'Independance), the most important minor party at the time, objected to the Istiqlal's predominance in the civil service and influence in Radio Maroc.\n",
      "There were rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary, `` non-political'' process, which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings.\n",
      "The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists, lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself'' would be supported by the King himself.\n",
      "The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections, but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time.\n",
      "In January, 1958, the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King, the rumors of election dates appeared once again, first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer.\n",
      "Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue.\n",
      "They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May, 1958, which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held.\n",
      "A titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections.\n",
      "In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence, but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent.\n",
      "Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide, minority parties, such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958, clamor for elections when out of power, but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power.\n",
      "Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process.\n",
      "The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco.\n",
      "The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country, but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections.\n",
      "Although the elections were for local officials, it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates.\n",
      "With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly.\n",
      "Both parties and the Ministry of the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and, thereby, give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance.\n",
      "Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.\n",
      "The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering, but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections.\n",
      "The newer party campaigned heavily, while the older, more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years.\n",
      "The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization, which depends heavily on U.M.T. support, was most effective.\n",
      "The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete, precise problems of internal politics.\n",
      "The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place.\n",
      "A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections.\n",
      "Furthermore, the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results.\n",
      "As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections.\n",
      "Apart from some areas of recurring trouble, like Bani Mellal, where inexperienced officials had been appointed, there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process.\n",
      "The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government under his personal direction.\n",
      "Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance, his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor.\n",
      "The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response.\n",
      "The qualifications to vote were kept very simple.\n",
      "Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future.\n",
      "The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act, which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $7 million to support, on a matching basis, state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture, trades, industrial skills and home economics.\n",
      "The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $29 million in addition to the $7 million under the Smith Act.\n",
      "Annual authorizations of $15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians.\n",
      "The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools.\n",
      "Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure, and the state or local districts must pay at least half.\n",
      "The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost, or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it.\n",
      "The greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.\n"

      "Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers, but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills.\n",
      "For a number of years Kentucky, Louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties.\n",
      "These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts.\n",
      "but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend, and evening extension courses also may be conducted.\n",
      "The Title 8, program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools.\n",
      "Relation to new industry\n",
      "Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry.\n",
      "A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees.\n",
      "Thus, besides the training provided to youth in school, the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts.\n",
      "The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant.\n",
      "This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas, for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country.\n",
      "Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers.\n",
      "While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements, there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning.\n",
      "The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys.\n",
      "Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills.\n",
      "No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained.\n",
      "There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable.\n",
      "State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities.\n",
      "There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs.\n",
      "A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided.\n",
      "There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs, even though they must pay tuition, receive no subsistence payments, and are not guaranteed a job.\n",
      "However, there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training.\n",
      "If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere, many more workers can be expected to respond.\n",
      "Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it.\n",
      "Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs.\n",
      "If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education, it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states.\n",
      "However, if Federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.\n",
      "Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities.\n",
      "A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate.\n",
      "This probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition, but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth Conservation Corps.\n",
      "A maximum of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home.\n",
      "Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas, the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training.\n",
      "Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual.\n",
      "Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance.\n",
      "And then the application of the count rules to the width( horizontally) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline.\n",

      "As the number of reported freight car loadings increased, this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity, and consequently increased stock earnings, implying fatter dividends, and implying therefore increased stock market prices.\n",
      "We now know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion, and that car loadings, while perhaps interesting enough, are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn.\n",
      "But the quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly, with all manner of investors and speculators participating, ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator, all seeking doggedly, studiously, daily -- and often nightly -- for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret: Which way will the market move -- up or down??\n",
      "It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth, a quest heavily invested in, during the days of wooden ships.\n",
      "There sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume, monthly averages of price-earnings ratios, ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines, ratios of an individual stock's performance to overall market performance, ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume, odd-lot indices, and what not.\n",
      "According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices, the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small trader, one who can't afford to trade round lots.\n",
      "Or, to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast, they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders.\n",
      "Falling most easily prey to an adverse market movement, for this rank of traders can least afford to lose, virtually anything the odd-lot traders do, marketwise, is taken to exemplify the `` wrong'' thing to do.\n",
      "Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe.\n",
      "They might, for example, plot it exactly as is, or they might make ten day moving averages of it, or longer moving averages, or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales.\n",
      "Towards the end of an intermediate or major rise, while the top is forming on the price chart, it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply.\n",
      "This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top.\n",
      "Similarly, at the opposite end of the market cycle, towards the end of an intermediate or major decline, usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart, it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood.\n",
      "While it had long been known in general, that `` the public is always wrong'', the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical basis.\n",
      "One might well wonder why the `` public is always wrong'' and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg.\n",
      "Is it really that the `` public'' buys at the tops, and not that the market tops out when the `` public'' buys??\n",
      "We have been using the word `` public'' in quotation marks, that is, in its vernacular connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory.\n",
      "Obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy, and vice versa.\n",
      "Strong hands differ from `` weak hands'' in that their operations are the primary movers.\n",
      "They initiate campaigns, so to speak, even if this initiation is diffused among them, and their concerted action only psychologically organized.\n",
      "When strong hands buy, they are able to buy more, and they do it even in the face of bearish news reports.\n",
      "They are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought.\n",
      "Needless to say, strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands, for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up, at higher prices, during the run-up phase of the campaign.\n",
      "Certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair, dirty, or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces.\n",
      "Try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose, and the majority would make consistent profits.\n",
      "Moreover, the taunt concerning the `` sophisticated'' echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during every campaign, and accrues only upon results;;\n",
      "It quite often happens that campaigns go askew, resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands into played-out hands, just as a member of a former campaign's `` public'' may emerge flatteringly `` right'' the next time.\n",
      "The study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow, what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few'' at the same time.\n",
      "The usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well, declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use.\n",
      "It has to, by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few''.\n",
      "Diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices, if there is to persist a market at all.\n",
      "Anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses.\n",
      "Mr. John Magee, whose work has been discussed in this chapter, was quoted in a New Yorker Magazine profile as saying: `` Of course, you have to remember it's a good thing for us chartists that there aren't more of us.\n",

      "Mr. Alexander H. Wheelan's Study Helps In Point And Figure Technique tells the readers: `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets''.\n",
      "What with traders trading for so many different objectives, and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use, and more coming into use all the time, it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans'' to invalidate itself.\n",
      "Nevertheless, all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression, if they lead to a market committment at all.\n",
      "Thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed, it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed.\n",
      "The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use, so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow, and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.\n",
      "By and large, what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates.\n",
      "The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident.\n",
      "Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer.\n",
      "It is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust.\n",
      "The rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline.\n",
      "In earlier business cycles, when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain.\n",
      "At this time, however, there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction.\n",
      "The 2% increase in retail sales in October to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board, which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans.\n",
      "The recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit, as well as by an expansion of Government spending, well sustained consumer spending, and some rebuilding of business inventories.\n",
      "It suggests that during the next several months, through the spring of 1961, the demand for long-term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower, especially the rates on Federal, state, and local bonds, as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds.\n",
      "However, as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present, as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters, the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high, so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great.\n",
      "It seems likely, moreover, that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions, interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year, although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate, e.g., easier downpayment and amortization terms.\n",
      "If the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here, we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit.\n",
      "Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility, as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system.\n",
      "However, the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold, as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy, which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle.\n",
      "One of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from confining their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into longer-term Government securities in the next few months.\n",
      "To the extent that the new Administration has its wishes, the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government securities and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rates.\n",
      "The principle of `` bills only'', or `` bills preferably'', seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities.\n",
      "However, to the extent that the monetary authorities, in their effort to ease credit in the next several months, conduct their open market operations in longer-term Government bonds, they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces.\n",
      "By the end of the spring of 1961, assuming that a general business recovery gets under way, interest rates should begin to edge upward again, depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability.\n",
      "My guess would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn.\n",
      "It is pertinent to ask the question: Has the long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course, and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates??\n",
      "My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies, and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels.\n",
      "Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us, and probably intensify, for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "This makes it certain that Federal expenditures for military preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years.\n",
      "We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition of the Communist bloc.\n",
      "Our efforts to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending.\n",
      "Moreover, it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country, to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs, will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education, housing, medical aid, and the like.\n",
      "There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures, of which I take a dim view, but it seems very likely to occur.\n",
      "During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations, which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building.\n",
      "According to the latest projections of the Bureau of the Census, the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years.\n",
      "Under the most favorable assumptions for increase, the Bureau of the Census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise from about 883,000 in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual rate of about 1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties, and to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the decade.\n",
      "During the Seventies the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade.\n",
      "The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950.\n",
      "With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties, a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated.\n",
      "State and local expenditures( in real terms) increased persistently from $26.5-billion in 1949 to $44.3-billion in 1959, and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade, which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion by 1970.\n",
      "It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play, the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties.\n",
      "Spurred by keen competition in our industrial system, and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research, plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade.\n",
      "In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook, I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War 2, is finally in the process of running dry.\n",
      "For example, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the VA home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself.\n",
      "Indeed, the failure of home-building as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing, and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings, may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end.\n",
      "In a way, we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the Fifties.\n",
      "The consuming public has used up a good part of these liquid assets, or they have been drained by the rising price level, and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier.\n",
      "This is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties.\n",
      "I am confident that it will, but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties.\n",
      "Accordingly, during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and, in the process, to require enormous amounts of capital funds.\n",
      "Wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases.\n",
      "The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature, but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries.\n",
      "While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable, the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2.\n",
      "The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition, but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny.\n",
      "Where the industry's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing'' and `` entry-limiting'' prices due to fears of public reaction, the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands.\n",
      "In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force, which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing'' on `` key'' wage bargains, we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces, such as union power, which may be relevant in an actual situation.\n",
      "For expository purposes, this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages.\n",
      "The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument, but is best read after Part 1, in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit.\n",
      "( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately.\n",
      "The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest.\n",
      "Because of its importance, and because the lack of price competition is well recognized, the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases.\n",
      "The threat of effective anti-trust action, provoked by `` gouging the public'' through price increases not justified by cost increases, and fears of endangering relations with customers, Congress, the general public and the press, all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases.\n",
      "For the industry of this model, the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price( given the wage rate and the level of GNP), and even below the entry-limited price( but not below average cost).\n",
      "For such an industry, it is only `` safe'' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified'' by rising costs( due to rising wages, etc.).\n",
      "Thus, if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge, this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate.\n",
      "In this model, we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes, so that the `` public-limit price'' only rises as the wage rate rises.\n",
      "In such circumstances, it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate.\n",
      "Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises, the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated, and is likely to remain well above the latter.\n",
      "The entry-limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition, but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy, we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price.\n",
      "Where this approach becomes critical, the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting'' the wage pressures of a powerful union, requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly'' acceded to the union pressure.\n",
      "Whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase, and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase.\n",
      "The extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things: the passage of time, the level of GNP, and the size of the wage increase.\n",
      "We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here, but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry.\n",
      "The industry may deliberately take a strike, not to put pressure on the union, but in order to `` educate'' the government and the customers of the industry.\n",
      "As a strike continues, these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement.\n",
      "They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail.\n",
      "Public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3% per month.\n",
      "Notice, however, that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se, without an accompanying wage increase.\n",
      "Similarly, higher levels of GNP do not, in themselves, provide grounds for raising prices, but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase.\n",
      "This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP, however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases.\n",
      "We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced( the average cost curve is horizontal, and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve), and is the same for every firm( and therefore for the industry).\n",
      "The level of average cost( equal to marginal cost) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate.\n",
      "The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership, and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate.\n",
      "The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment.\n",
      "The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases, and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases, but we abstract from these forces here.\n",
      "For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments), and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs.\n",
      "Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry, much less to the union or to the public.\n",
      "Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared.\n",
      "The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate.\n",
      "We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases, and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real'' wage rate.\n",
      "For internal political reasons, the union asks for( and accepts) increases in the basic wage rate, and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate, but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry.\n",
      "However, it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate, although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude.\n",
      "In this model, then, the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate, but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may, in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2, below, find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise.\n",
      "The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case, on the grounds that it is `` clearly'' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously.\n",
      "From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model.\n",
      "It is this conclusion that we challenge;;\n",
      "It is convenient to assume that the union-industry contract is of one year's duration.\n",
      "In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law.\n",
      "Several factors contributed to this change.\n",
      "The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow.\n",
      "Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe, but for the world.\n",
      "Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century.\n",
      "International law had to fit the conditions of Europe, and nothing that could not fit this system, or the interests of the great European nations collectively, could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense.\n",
      "Essentially this imposed two conditions: First, international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive, suspicious, and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another;;\n",
      "second, it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared.\n",
      "It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions.\n",
      "On the one hand, the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty, independence, formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment'' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience.\n",
      "But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world.\n",
      "Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine, itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power'' system in Europe) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance'' itself.\n",
      "A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality;;\n",
      "More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations'';;\n",
      "Wheaton stated that the public law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin''.\n",
      "Now, with virtually every writer, not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon, but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others.\n",
      "The European customs on which international law was based were to become, by force and fiat, the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states.\n",
      "They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter, or some of them, which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction''.\n",
      "A number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law;;\n",
      "that is, from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states.\n",
      "The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens, to foreigners, and to each other in a conceptually unified system.\n",
      "The theory of international law, which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America, broke this unity and this universality.\n",
      "It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations.\n",
      "No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do;;\n",
      "his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action.\n",
      "To appreciate this development, we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy.\n",
      "First, and most obvious, was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state, and the individual's identification with the state, as transcending other ties of social solidarity.\n",
      "In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation.\n",
      "A state, the highest form of human organization in fact and theory, could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will, or consent.\n",
      "According to the new theories, the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign'' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors.\n",
      "He no longer sought to find the law;;\n",
      "he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be.\n",
      "There was no law, domestic or international, except that willed by, acknowledged by, or consented to by states.\n",
      "Related to, but distinguishable from, nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another.\n",
      "The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions, particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization, led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions.\n",
      "Law became a conscious process, something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms.\n",
      "Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many, when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed.\n",
      "The old way of doing things, which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations, was no longer adequate to the task.\n",
      "First was the period of codification of existing law: the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that, in fact, resulted from Austin's restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England.\n",
      "The legislative mills have been grinding ever since, and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task, a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another, to the executive.\n",
      "In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative judiciary.\n",
      "When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands -- two purposes were served: Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will, and law became a rational system for implementing that will, for serving conscious goals, for embodying the `` public policy''.\n",
      "It is true that, initially, the task was to remove restrictions that, it was thought, inhibited the free flow of money, goods, and labor;;\n",
      "It was not opposed to either justice or morality;;\n",
      "it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority.\n",
      "To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie, and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible;;\n",
      "that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated;;\n",
      "that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market;;\n",
      "that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with.\n",
      "It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract.\n",
      "In fact, some -- Anzilotti is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm, Pacta sunt Servanda.\n",
      "The displacement( at least to a considerable extent) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law theory and doctrine.\n",
      "In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law, rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system.\n",
      "One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations.\n",
      "States were free to enact, within broad, though( perhaps) determinate limits, their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts, to vary the law merchant, and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas.\n",
      "The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation, and then largely in marginal situations.\n",
      "Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1, power.\n",
      "If this seems arbitrary, its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction.\n",
      "For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts( subject to review by the Supreme Court) for the protection of most rights arising under national law.\n",
      "Then in 1875, apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War, Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions.\n",
      "One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference.\n",
      "An amendment, presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves, became a `` laissez-faire'' limitation upon state economic policy.\n",
      "In 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter.\n",
      "The essential ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate orders.\n",
      "Drawing upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor, Mr. Justice Holmes introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention.\n",
      "On review the Supreme Court, via Mr. Justice Frankfurter, found southern racial problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to adjudication is open''.\n",
      "An alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the offending order had in fact been authorized.\n",
      "Reluctant, as usual, to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination'' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction.\n",
      "But it is crucial that here, unlike Burford, the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question.\n",
      "`` The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication''.\n",
      "refusal to adjudicate is another.\n",
      "To the extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation, federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter.\n",
      "In Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Ry. Co., the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain `` uneconomic'' train facilities.\n",
      "The Court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed;;\n",
      "But they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of Congress:\n",
      "`` By one fell swoop the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910, 1913, 1925, 1934 and 1937.\n",
      "By these measures, Congress, so the Court( in effect) now decides, gave not only needless but inadequate relief, since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the Act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging local regulation''.\n",
      "it does not establish any law( rights) for the federal judges to enforce.\n",
      "How can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none??\n",
      "The Court held that Congress had intended the federal judiciary to `` fashion'' an appropriate law of labor-management contracts.\n",
      "In short, congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create, or specify, the right to be enforced.\n",
      "The Lincoln Mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal `` common law'' which, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in dissent, leads to one of the following `` incongruities'': ``(( 1) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements;;\n",
      "The Justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that Congress' purpose was merely to make unions suable.\n",
      "With a few exceptions, the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges.\n",
      "To avoid these constitutional difficulties, Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with diversity, rather than federal question, jurisdiction.\n",
      "( As we have seen, the Erie and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state decisional rules.\n",
      "If Congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily occupied, let it do so knowingly and explicitly.\n",
      "And let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges.\n",
      "Does Lincoln Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases, the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages??\n",
      "It has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "A careful student has suggested that `` In any new revision( of the Judicial Code) the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law might be used, leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law''.\n",
      "Obviously, the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinions -- to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion.\n",
      "Mr. Justice Black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just'' result.\n",
      "With few exceptions, Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law.\n",
      "To put it differently, state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right.\n",
      "To insure uniformity in the meaning of national law, however, state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review.\n",
      "It may be noted, parenthetically, that to evade `` desegregation'' an ex-Justice and former southern governor has urged Congress to abolish this reviewing authority.\n",
      "The result, of course, would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states.\n",
      "The first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance.\n",
      "Subject to certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials, each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures.\n",
      "Litigants who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure.\n",
      "A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals, e.g., in diversity cases.\n",
      "The result was that the plaintiff's case was dismissed.\n",
      "Mr. Justice Black led a reversing majority: `` Strict local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law''.\n",
      "Here, as in the Byrd case, another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law.\n",
      "Justices Frankfurter and Jackson dissented: `` One State may cherish formalities more than another, one State may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms.\n",
      "If a litigant chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court, he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the particularity, for instance, with which a cause of action must be described.\n",
      "Federal law, though invoked in a State court, delimits the Federal claim -- defines what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it.\n",
      "But the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it, so long as a requirement does not add to, or diminish, the right as defined by Federal law, nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation''.\n",
      "The accused did not object to the trial court's charge to the jury that discourse `` may constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest.\n",
      "'' For present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal Constitution.\n",
      "That is, he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right.\n",
      "How else can one explain, for example, allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium( section 381(c)(9)), but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses;;\n",
      "or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization( section 381(c)(16)), but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it;;\n",
      "or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation( section 381(c)(6)), but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization;;\n",
      "or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company( section 381(c)(14)), but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes??\n",
      "These items, and most of the others listed above, seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381.\n",
      "There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities.\n",
      "With respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381(c), viewed in historical perspective, suggest a rule requiring survival, whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation.\n",
      "It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes.\n",
      "and in at least one instance, involving refund claims, it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code.\n",
      "The leading case, Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States, held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor, and it has been consistently followed.\n",
      "The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties, one of them a stranger to the claim, and to prevent traffic in claims, particularly tenuous claims, against the Government.\n",
      "Neither reason, said the Court, applied to the case at hand;;\n",
      "furthermore, Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states.\n",
      "A tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law'' mold.\n",
      "Although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash, to which section 203 quite clearly applies, the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund of taxes paid by transferors.\n",
      "A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States, in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership, whose partners were former stockholders, and then to another corporation formed by the partners.\n",
      "Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim, the Court cited the Seaboard, Novo Trading, and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute''.\n",
      "The anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation.\n",
      "The Court, nevertheless, relied on the Seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same.\n"

      "Revenue Ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation, a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax, followed by the name of the successor corporation.\n",
      "if the succession is not of record, all documents relating to such succession, properly certified, are required.\n",
      "The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation, the latter to a contractual acquisition.\n",
      "The Ruling would not, however, apply to an acquisition of assets for cash.\n",
      "The Ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization.\n",
      "Hence, a successor corporation in a C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section 203.\n",
      "In a B reorganization, followed by a section 332 liquidation, those cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor.\n",
      "In fact, a cash purchase of a corporation's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the Kimbell-Diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step.\n",
      "As stated in Seaboard and numerous other cases, the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis.\n",
      "The first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381(a), which is the only type presently under discussion.\n",
      "Section 381(a) applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent, a statutory merger or consolidation, an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock, or a change of identity, form, or place of organization.\n",
      "In virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated, and its former stockholders either own outright, or have a continuing stock interest in, the assets which gave rise to the tax.\n",
      "Furthermore, in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger, to which the statute is clearly inapplicable.\n",
      "Nor is it at all likely that a `` desperate'' claim against the Government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization.\n",
      "If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim, it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes.\n",
      "If such an unlikely transaction were to take place, it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase, followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary, followed by liquidation.\n",
      "It appears, then, that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381(c), a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381(a) is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation.\n",
      "Section 203 of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free reorganizations.\n",
      "The successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims.\n",
      "The parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368(a)(1), but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not, for example, elected to file consolidated returns with its own subsidiaries.\n",
      "Similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting( section 381(c)(4)) or depreciation( section 381(c)(6)).\n",
      "Section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property transferred, and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee.\n",

      "Attributes similar to a loss carryover.\n",
      "There may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items.\n",
      "For example, suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted, providing for carryover of excess profits credits.\n",
      "It is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income;;\n",
      "it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax.\n",
      "Under the 1939 Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the Stanton Brewery case, but only over the dissent of Judge Learned Hand, who wrote the majority opinion in the Sansome case, a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization.\n",
      "Since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954, one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have.\n",
      "With respect to this type of item, one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report, quoted above, which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein.\n",
      "Actually, there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover.\n",
      "There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available:( 1) interviews in depth with a few selected companies, and( 2) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire.\n",
      "While the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions, it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies.\n",
      "As a result, it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government.\n",
      "It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature.\n",
      "It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations.\n",
      "There is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents.\n",
      "Simple `` yes'' or `` no'' answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have.\n",
      "A respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question.\n",
      "Finally, there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives.\n",
      "In the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered, and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations.\n",
      "The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of information:( 1) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents, including their experience with, and interest in, securing defense business;;\n",
      "It was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did.\n",
      "The major sections of the questionnaire( see Appendix B) are devoted to the following: 1.\n",
      "The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional.\n",
      "The questionnaire also stated that, in any event, all replies would be treated confidentially.\n",
      "It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves.\n",
      "In June, 1960, an early draft of the questionnaire, along with a cover letter, was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington.\n",
      "Several days after the companies had received the questionnaire, members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the questionnaire.\n",
      "The research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country, or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made.\n",
      "The revised draft was mailed in July, 1960, to 100 firms throughout the United States.\n",
      "Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed, follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once.\n",
      "The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent.\n",
      "The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs.\n",
      "The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind.\n",
      "The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work.\n",
      "The second list was derived from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace Industries Association.\n",
      "Each source selected from its approved bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems.\n",
      "There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive.\n",
      "By these steps the final AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500.\n",
      "It was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the Aerospace Industries Association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs.\n",
      "The fact that the Aerospace Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs.\n",
      "The fact that companies on the AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection.\n",
      "The fact that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis.\n",
      "Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm.\n",
      "The questionnaires were mailed in Seattle, Washington, and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.\n",
      "Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed, a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names.\n",
      "The first test mailing( to 14 companies) was made in June, 1960.\n",
      "The second test mailing( to 100 companies) was made in July, 1960.\n",
      "The final mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August, 1960, to 4,900 firms consisting of 3,450 from the AIA list and 1,450 from the TR list.\n",
      "They continued to arrive until the end of December, 1960, by which time a total of 1,343 returns were received representing 26.8 per cent of the 5,014 questionnaires sent out.\n",
      "Fifty-seven returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed.\n",
      "The remaining 1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2.\n",
      "All responses, except comments, were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment.\n",
      "In order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the respondent.\n",
      "The first step in processing was to analyze the returns from Questions 1, 2, and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses, in accordance with the definitions contained in ASPR Section 1-701.\n",
      "The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms.\n",
      "The second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the TR list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study.\n",
      "It was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in, or wishing to sell to, defense programs.\n",
      "In the first place, the two groups of firms, when combined, had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the AIA list alone.\n",
      "It is not a pleasant or easy position, but one we have endeavored to maintain.\n",
      "We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties, but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose.\n",
      "We have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding.\n",
      "It is disconcerting, nevertheless, to read in a labor weekly, `` Perluss knuckles down to growers'', and then to be confronted with a growers' publication which states, `` Perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumped-up strikes as bona fide''.\n",
      "For a number of years, there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers.\n",
      "This past year the pattern has been different: The organizing program had the full support of the AFL-CIO, which supplied staff and money to the AWOC, as well as moral support.\n",
      "Regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties, failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life.\n",
      "The AWOC has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the picket line -- with considerable success, particularly in the area of wages.\n",
      "By the very nature of the situation, it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management.\n",
      "that is to say, to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time, rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the State.\n",
      "Normally, because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance, we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the Unemployment Insurance Code, although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility.\n",
      "But the current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists, and out of Public Law 78 and the Migrant Labor Agreement if Mexican nationals were employed at the ranch.\n",
      "California has accepted the provisions of that Act( as have all other States) by enacting into our Code( Section 2051) a provision that\n",
      "The State of California accepts the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act.\n",
      "With respect to labor disputes, the Wagner-Peyser Act states only,\n",
      "In carrying out the provisions of this Act, the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment.\n",
      "Other provisions of the Act empower the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions, and he has done so.\n",
      "No person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which( 1) is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or( 2) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute.\n",
      "With respect to positions not covered by subparagraph( 1) or( 2) of this paragraph, any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists, provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral.\n",
      "We concluded that we may refer workers to the fieldwork( but not the packing shed work) provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute.\n",
      "It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue.\n",
      "Note that it prohibits referrals under either condition( 1) or condition( 2).\n",
      "Employer representatives have contended that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition, on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists.\n",
      "We found that a labor dispute existed, and that the workers had left their jobs, which were then vacant because of the dispute.\n",
      "Accordingly, under clause( 1) of the Secretary's Regulation, we suspended referrals to the employer.\n",
      ") The employer, seeking to continue his harvest, challenged our right to cease referrals to him, and sought relief in the Superior Court of Yuba County.\n",
      "The court issued a temporary restraining order, directing us to resume referrals.\n",
      "However, the Attorney General of California, at the request of the Secretary of Labor, sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court, on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary's Regulation was being challenged.\n",
      "However, the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code, and presumably therefore also the regulations, it was now a State matter.\n",
      "It accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction, whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining order permanent.\n",
      "Under that order, we have continued referring workers to the ranch.\n",
      "A similar case arose at the Bowers ranch in Butte County, and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders.\n",
      "The growers have strenuously argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary's Regulation.\n",
      "I cannot accept that view, either as a lawyer or as an administrator.\n",
      "It is an accepted juridical principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent.\n",
      "It is conclusive, unless appealed, only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard.\n",
      "It is not binding upon another Superior Court, which could rule to the contrary.\n",
      "In that event, we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter, and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts.\n",
      "But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision, I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law.\n",
      "The Attorney General of California concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of Appeal.\n",
      "The Attorney General of the United States, in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers, has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority.\n",
      "Further, and as an evidence of legislative intent only, the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the `` Holland Amendment'' to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters.\n",
      "Next, let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals.\n",
      "There is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair.\n",
      "A decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations, and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers.\n",
      "The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior Courts in the State.\n",
      "It is an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial finality is achieved.\n",
      "As an administrator, I cannot place the Employment Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me.\n",
      "To have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court, in my opinion, would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor, were he so inclined, to notify the Governor of such noncompliance, set a date for hearing, and issue his finding.\n",
      "Thus far, the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition( 1) in the Regulation of the Secretary.\n",
      "None has yet arisen under condition( 2), relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute''.\n",
      "Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications, union membership, union jurisdiction, and the like??\n",
      "He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one;;\n",
      "that is, that if wages, for example, is the only issue in a labor dispute, and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute, we may continue to make referrals.\n",
      "Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them.\n",
      "they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely.\n",
      "The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age.\n",
      "Many studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science;;\n",
      "that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events;;\n",
      "and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden.\n",
      "A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects.\n",
      "Typically, the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time, as contrasted to those of an adult.\n",
      "As the child grows older, his emotional reactions lead to `` moods'', or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly, rather than in short, abrupt outbursts.\n",
      "Studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects, noises, falling, and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years, but that fears of the dark, of being alone, and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase.\n",
      "Ridiculing a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem;;\n",
      "Children need help in learning to control their emotions.\n",
      "The young child learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums, screaming, kicking, and hitting will not get him what he wants;;\n",
      "the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers, and, therefore, makes a real effort to control his emotions.\n",
      "the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals, struggling to meet their developmental needs, and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership.\n",
      "the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore.\n",
      "In late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase;;\n",
      "In early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older, who can do the things he likes to do;;\n",
      "loyalty to the group, a feeling of superiority over those who are not members, and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits.\n",
      "During late childhood boys like to tease, jostle, and talk smart to girls;;\n",
      "By the time pupils reach the sixth grade, their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed;;\n",
      "Between the ages of two and four years, negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable;;\n",
      "after the fourth year it begins to decline.\n",
      "However, as we have seen, in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers.\n",
      "The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups.\n",
      "The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion, but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger;;\n",
      "he wants to be with people, but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate.\n",
      "In the middle grades, however, he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader, helping to make plans and carry on group activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise.\n",
      "Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit;;\n",
      "others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom.\n",
      "These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand.\n",
      "These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention, by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom, and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children.\n",
      "It is the classroom teacher, however, who has daily contacts with pupils, and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice.\n",
      "Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals.\n",
      "What they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success, and that they still must be treated as individuals.\n",
      "Factors that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment\n",
      "Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally, and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects.\n",
      "One study, which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six, found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity.\n",
      "It is apparent, therefore, that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children.\n",
      "When a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning, insecurity, unhappiness, and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow.\n",
      "It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy, or that the child who lacks interest in school, who dislikes the teacher, or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent.\n",
      "They may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work.\n",
      "Teaching methods, learning materials, and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children.\n",
      "This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children.\n",
      "A vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading.\n",
      "An impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school.\n",
      "At any rate, the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement, failure, and maladjustment.\n",
      "Successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment.\n",
      "The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist;;\n",
      "he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom.\n",
      "He can be expected, however, to examine and interpret the information already available;;\n",
      "to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children;;\n",
      "and to utilize opportunities, arising in connection with regular classroom activities, for gaining a better understanding of his pupils.\n",
      "This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher;;\n",
      "These records, when systematically maintained, provide much information about the children, which the teacher can use in guidance, instruction, grouping, and reporting to parents.\n",
      "Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file, equipped with a lock, which is used to store cumulative record folders.\n",
      "Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records.\n",
      "Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date.\n",
      "Some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used.\n",
      "The Summary Report, which was prepared for this Conference, indicates, first, that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing;;\n",
      "second, that both actual and pending desegregation is, with few exceptions, the product or result of court order.\n",
      "The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow.\n",
      "The states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation, in fact some dating back to 1954;;\n",
      "Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order.\n",
      "Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties, which already had high school desegregation.\n",
      "thus, county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation.\n",
      "In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties.\n",
      "Negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and Warren Counties.\n",
      "This recapitulation makes it clear that school desegregation continues, including the Old Dominion State, in spite of its stern resistance.\n",
      "The record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order;;\n",
      "that on the immediate horizon, if further large-scale( relatively speaking) desegregation comes, it will result from court orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states.\n",
      "Knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow.\n",
      "Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this Regional Conference, I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia.\n",
      "That reference in the Report is `` continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro school system'', a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro school population from 74.1 per cent to 76.7 per cent.\n",
      "The sharpest break with tradition, the past and present of `` White Ring Around a Black Core'', may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County suburbs to Negro residents and, presumably, the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs.\n",
      "In fact, short of fleeing to Warrenton, Virginia, or Rockville, Maryland, white people may have to live with Negroes.\n",
      "Problems to solve\n",
      "I believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color.\n",
      "In general, members of NAIRO would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone.\n",
      "How to achieve this objective is a problem, but we are not divided on what we want.\n",
      "It may be county school board or state school board action, as well as that of municipal school boards.\n",
      "Correlatively, can we reduce the role of the district courts, so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court??\n",
      "This is a problem, and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation.\n",
      "Not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration, that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro, but as human beings.\n",
      "Again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education;;\n",
      "Fifth, in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or all-white schools, how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group??\n",
      "Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children'' when the latter are not actually present.\n",
      "On the basis of pupil assignment criteria, Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white schools in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia.\n",
      "On the other hand, looking at the larger picture, is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off, blocked, or reduced school desegregation to a `` trickle''??\n",
      "Teacher assignment in order to desegregate.\n",
      "In large cities like Baltimore, Louisville, and Washington, D.C., should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by assigning white and Negro teachers, respectively??\n",
      "On the one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race??\n",
      "Or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other school, we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely, to a teacher of another race.\n",
      "We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation.\n",
      "The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation.\n",
      "And I have established that the action of municipal, county, or state school boards or boards of education is small, infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of districts.\n",
      "Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement??\n",
      "Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance??\n",
      "Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated, should we nevertheless support such a clause??\n",
      "Withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race.\n",
      "Should we support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his race??\n",
      "This is softer than earlier Powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts.\n",
      "There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause, softened though it be, on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools.\n",
      "Should a political subdivision, state or county or municipality, be required to furnish public education??\n",
      "For the school year, 1959-1960, the Prince Edward County( Virginia) Board of Supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education, and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or Negro children.\n",
      "Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education??\n",
      "If people don't want to provide public education, should they be forced to do so??\n",
      "Even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education, we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation.\n",
      "If, on the other hand, it is not settled, or while it is being debated and resolved, does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in Prince Edward County??\n",
      "On the whole, it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way.\n",
      "The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers, and such issues are not issues of educational policy.\n",
      "In general, it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy, and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values, which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society.\n",
      "If there were more such cases, it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes.\n",
      "In a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values, it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society.\n",
      "The problem arises, if it does arise, when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence, but which bears some relation to the social structure.\n",
      "The answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's own social-class position and also upon his social history, as well as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator.\n",
      "In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class backgrounds, Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as well as on his social-class background.\n",
      "One upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb, while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home, and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment.\n",
      "One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families.\n",
      "While this influence is a complex matter, depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience, there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth.\n",
      "that is, they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value.\n",
      "This does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education, as contrasted with liberal education, but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement value, as against a kind of `` pure'' liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs.\n",
      "There is no doubt that higher education since World War 2, has moved away from `` pure'' liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and specialization.\n",
      "Compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930, the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working-class fathers.\n",
      "Their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents, who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum.\n",
      "Educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest.\n",
      "They generally vote so as to serve their own constituency, and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class, they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education.\n",
      "Another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations.\n",
      "Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society, as they conceive it.\n",
      "President Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal, expansionist position, while President Eisenhower's Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative.\n",
      "Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people, who attempted to act in the public interest.\n",
      "This might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias, but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S. Hollingshead entitled Who Should Go To College??\n",
      "Furthermore, the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education.\n",
      "Thus, the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education.\n",
      "Then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations, who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs, experiments, and demonstrations.\n",
      "These people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons, who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society.\n",
      "Like the other policy-making groups, these are middle class in their educational attitudes, and they attempt to act in the general public interest, as they see it.\n",
      "In general, it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole.\n",
      "They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account.\n",
      "But there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education.\n",
      "They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society.\n",
      "Attempts to influence social structure through education\n",
      "In so far as this goal is achieved, the society becomes more fluid, artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced, and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society.\n",
      "On the other hand, there is a counterbalancing purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children.\n",
      "This leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools.\n",
      "Fifty years ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement.\n",
      "The recent federal government's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth.\n",
      "It is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade, because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records( who were usually middle-class), and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the private colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds.\n",
      "Unfortunately, however, and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter, no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues.\n",
      "And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service.\n",
      "One such disagreement, which will receive attention in this next chapter, concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service, in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination, must be made directly proportional to marginal costs, or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs.\n",
      "Here, the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.\n",
      "Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs'', the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice.\n",
      "By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs, and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution.\n",
      "The first, or double-step, type might also be called the `` railroad type'' because of its application to railroads( and other transportation agencies) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n",
      "The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs'' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's `` long-run marginal costs''.\n",
      "There remains a residue of total costs, or total `` revenue requirements'' which, since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density, is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis.\n",
      "Nevertheless, because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs, it has apportioned this residue, which it sometimes calls `` burden'', among the units of carload traffic on a basis( partly ton, partly ton-mile) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination.\n",
      ") has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet.\n",
      "Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates, it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs.\n",
      "Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable.\n",
      "But in any event, full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses: namely, that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service;;\n",
      "and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination.\n",
      "We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which, unlike the `` railroad type'', draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment: the single-step type.\n",
      "It might be called the `` public utility'' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases.\n",
      "Here no attempt is made, first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed'' residues of total costs.\n",
      "Instead, all of the total costs are treated as variable costs, although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables.\n",
      "Moreover, whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost'' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output, in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost'' has been used more broadly, so as to cover costs which, while a function of some one variable( such as output of energy, or number of customers), are not necessarily a linear function.\n",
      "This `` grand division'' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class, such as street lighting, or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes.\n",
      "But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all, or nearly all, classes of customers;;\n",
      "and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates.\n",
      "The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis.\n",
      "But before turning to this example, we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis, both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type.\n",
      "Here, an apportionment, say, of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers.\n",
      "But in the second subtype, which I take to be the one more frequently applied, only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital'' or `` fair return'' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service.\n",
      "But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return'' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service.\n",
      "Thus, during any given year( A) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000,( B) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000, and( C) if the net investment in( or value of) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000, the cost analyst will report that residential service, in the aggregate, has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent.\n",
      "There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital'' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably, the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital'' or `` fair rate of return''.\n",
      "But the practice is likely to be misleading, since it may seem to support a conclusion that, as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment, however low, the rates of charge for this service are compensatory.\n",
      "Needless to say, any such inference would be quite unwarranted.\n"

      "In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis, let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant.\n",
      "Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service, all of which is supplied at the same voltage, phase, etc. to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\n",
      "This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions.\n",
      "Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service, we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple;;\n",
      "indeed, that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business, followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption.\n",
      "For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output( or consumption) of energy.\n",

      "But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service, and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs.\n",
      "Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn, recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes;;\n",
      "These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless, or almost regardless, of power consumption.\n",
      "These minimum costs may come to $1 per month, more or less, for residential and small commercial customers, although they are substantially higher for large industrial users, who require more costly connections and metering devices.\n",
      "While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates, in the form of a mere `` service charge'', they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment.\n",
      "But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including, not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary( low-voltage) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity.\n",

      "There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger, pain, and fear, it has all but eaten off its own leg.\n",
      "As we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered, we are very likely to say: `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so''.\n",
      "The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion.\n",
      "I hold, on the contrary, that we mean to assert something of the pain itself, namely, that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred.\n",

      "nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured;;\n",
      "Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows.\n",
      "Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered.\n",
      "Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did??\n",
      "Indeed, we should say, on the contrary, that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain, that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not.\n",
      "If so, then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only.\n",
      "We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it.\n",
      "It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this, whereas on positivist grounds it should be.\n",
      "It ideally removes the past event, and shows that this would render false what we mean to say, whereas on positivist grounds it should not.\n",
      "Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all, but that we mistakenly believe it did, and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing.\n",
      "On the positivist theory, everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second.\n",
      "In the only sense in which badness is involved at all, whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety, since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling, and that feeling is still there.\n",
      "If anyone asked us, after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing, whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all, we should say that it made all the difference in the world, that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there, that if this had not occurred, there was nothing left to be bad, and that our assertion was in that case mistaken.\n",
      "The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake, because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering, seems to me merely frivolous.\n",
      "If we did not mean to say this, why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred??\n",
      "On the theory before us, such relief would be groundless, for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all, and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about.\n",
      "He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval.\n",
      "And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself.\n",
      "but unfortunately the rabbit, on no grounds at all, took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time, and in the only intelligible sense, bad.\n",
      "This way of escape is theoretically possible, but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not, so far as I know, been urged by positivists, it is perhaps best not to spend time over it.\n",
      "I come now to a third argument, which again is very simple.\n",
      "the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling.\n",
      "But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again.\n",
      "And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded.\n",
      "and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is, as we say, quite dead.\n",
      "And this seems to me untrue.\n",
      "When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point, but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before, we should certainly answer Yes.\n",
      "We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time, but that it was the same point we were making.\n",
      "And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express.\n",
      "I come now to a fourth consideration.\n",
      "We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not;;\n",
      "Broad and Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics, and I suspect they are right.\n",
      "But that is not exactly my point.\n",
      "My point is this: whether there is such fitness or not, we all assume that there is, and if we do, we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do.\n",
      "Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting.\n",
      "If we were asked why we thought so, we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong, and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting.\n",
      "There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting.\n",
      "But if that is true, why is any attitude more fitting than any other??\n",
      "Would applause, for example, be fitting if, apart from the applause, there were nothing good to applaud??\n",
      "Would condemnation be fitting if, independently of the condemnation, there were nothing bad to condemn??\n",
      "In such a case, any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other, which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point.\n",
      "Indeed, we are forced to go much farther.\n",
      "and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright.\n",
      "On the other hand, to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good;;\n",
      "This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also.\n",
      "In any event, the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind'', while at the same time, apparently, the sense of touch remained essentially intact.\n",
      "Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images, a condition in which, for example, one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence.\n",
      "This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that, when the patient closed his eyes, he had absolutely no spatial( that is, third-dimensional) awareness whatsoever.\n",
      "The necessary inference, as the authors themselves interpret it, would seem to be this: ``(( 1) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch, as such.\n",
      "that is, there is, in the true sense, only a visual space''.\n",
      "The underlying assumption, of course, is that only sight and touch enable us, in any precise and fully dependable way, to locate objects in space beyond us, the other senses being decidedly inferior, if not totally inadequate, in this regard.\n",
      "This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel.\n",
      "Therefore, if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled, the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary.\n",
      "( 1) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed??\n",
      "( 2) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind??\n",
      "( 3) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury??\n",
      "Obviously, a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative, if the argument is to get under way at all, for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion, any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether, of course, as evidence to establish the desired conclusion.\n",
      "The answer the authors give to it, therefore, is of supreme importance.\n",
      "It is as follows: `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness( pressure, pain, temperature), as well as the kinesthetic sensations( muscular feelings, feelings in the tendons and joints), were, as such, essentially intact, although they seemed, in comparison with normal reactions, to be somewhat diminished over the entire body.\n",
      "The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member, as well as the direction and scope of a movement, passively executed( with one of his members), proved to have been, on the contrary, very considerably affected''.\n",
      "The authors insist, however, that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight.\n",
      "First of all, what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged??\n",
      "And he could recognize, by touch alone, articles which he had handled immediately before, even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him;;\n",
      "that is, he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was.\n",
      "Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight, the patient had to train himself for a new line of work, that of a portfolio-maker, an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour.\n",
      "It seems clear, when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question, the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient), that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision.\n",
      "And so the authors conclude: `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work, even more than the foregoing facts( mentioned above under 1), leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch, in the ordinary sense of the word, was unaffected;;\n",
      "or, to put the same thing in physiological terms, that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus, from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain, -- that is, from one end to the other -- was unimpaired''.\n",
      "If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point, it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition.\n",
      "But before we can do this, we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2;;\n",
      "then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand.\n",
      "The meaning of this, as we shall see, is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects;;\n",
      "Instead, he constantly became lost in parts and components of them, confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects, and so on, unless he allowed time to `` trace'' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours.\n",
      "According to his own testimony, he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots'' of color of a more or less indefinite size;;\n",
      "could piece, as it were, the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be.\n",
      "If, however, the figure to be discerned were complicated, composed of several interlocking subfigures, and so on, even the tracing process failed him, and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts.\n",
      "This meant, concretely, that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body, became easily confused by `` hasher marks'' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters, and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it.\n",
      "The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all;;\n",
      "and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him.\n",
      "After a conversation with another man, he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like.\n",
      "In short, both his own declarations and his figural blindness, when he looked at objects, seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all.\n",
      "He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed, precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape, already learned and held in visual memory, as persons of normal vision do.\n",
      "Therefore, his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object;;\n",
      "This would mean, it can readily be seen, that, again, for each new visual experience, the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery.\n",
      "As one would surmise, the procedure, however, could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough, so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape, which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference.\n",
      "Men, trees, automobiles, houses, and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable, at the very beginning of tracing, by an inference as to what each was.\n",
      "And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it.\n",
      "Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly, without the tracing motions, solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared in his visual experience.\n",
      "Perhaps the very important question -- What is, then, exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things??\n",
      "If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually, then, it would seem, the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations, at least in regard to two dimensions, and, as we shall see, even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors.\n",
      "The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability, tactually,( 1) to perceive figure and( 2) to locate objects in space, with his eyes closed( or turned away from the object concerned).\n",
      "Quite naturally, they make the investigation, first, by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then, later, by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to.\n",
      "When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all, the following striking results occurred.\n",
      "Whenever artists, indeed, turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures, which were rare down to 800 B.C., they tended to reflect reality( see Plate 6a, 9b);;\n",
      "To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment.\n",
      "At the least, however, one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order;;\n",
      "their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line.\n",
      "Their world, again, was a still simple, traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life.\n",
      "And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure.\n",
      "The storms of the past had died away, and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds.\n",
      "The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future'', and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated.\n",
      "Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough, detailed study which it deserves, partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations, as at Argos, are only now coming to light.\n",
      "From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects, however, the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C.\n",
      "The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree.\n",
      "Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800.\n",
      "the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800.\n",
      "Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct;;\n",
      "One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and, without any knowledge of its place of origin, venture to assign it to a specific area;;\n",
      "These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half.\n",
      "On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad.\n",
      "Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression, nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure.\n",
      "The epic poems, the consolidation of the Greek pantheon, the rise of firm political units, the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men -- all these had to await the progress of following decades.\n",
      "To interpret, indeed, the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information;;\n",
      "if we could see more deeply, we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period.\n",
      "The historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence, and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding.\n",
      "the ceramic material of the age is more abundant, more diversified, and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers, who begin to show scenes of human life and death.\n",
      "Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century, we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful.\n",
      "Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era, this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750.\n",
      "Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution, in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth.\n",
      "The revolution was well under way before 700 B.C., and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century.\n",
      "trade was just beginning to expand;;\n",
      "The modern student, who knows what was to come next, is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century.\n",
      "Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas;;\n",
      "Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era, I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization.\n",
      "for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself.\n",
      "The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750.\n",
      "We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery, the epic and the myth, and the religious evolution of early Greece;;\n",
      "the important point, however, is that these magnificent achievements, unlike those of later decades, were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models.\n",
      "but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance.\n",
      "In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos.\n",
      "They had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses.\n",
      "The potters, in particular, had virtually eschewed freehand drawing, elaborate motifs, and the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe.\n",
      "it was time to take bigger steps, to venture on experiments.\n",
      "Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited.\n",
      "instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep.\n",
      "Wavy lines, feather-like patterns, rosettes of indefinitely floral nature, birds either singly or in stylized rows, animals in solemn frieze bands( see Plates 11- 12) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze.\n",
      "Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined, it seems to appear first in the Cyclades, which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century.\n",
      "Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction, he later released him.\n",
      "Even while suffering the trip to his home, Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian.\n",
      "Three weeks later, following his recovery, armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney, Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez.\n",
      "Arriving at daybreak, they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender.\n",
      "Instead, he whirled and ran to his house for a gun, forcing them to kill him, Cook reported.\n",
      "Both Cook's and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing, but the company officers felt that in the end, it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion.\n",
      "General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away, and try to have a few punished.\n",
      "On February 17, Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased.\n",
      "It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream.\n",
      "Suspecting an ambush, the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill.\n",
      "After spending two nights( Wednesday and Thursday) in Catskill, the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business.\n",
      "Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. Armstrong, occupied by a Mexican, his wife, and an old trapper.\n",
      "There were three houses in Salyer's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff, the road winding along the top, entering above, and then passing down in front of the houses, thence to the Vermejo.\n",
      "With the first reports, Russell's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook, followed by a hail of bullets, raced towards the arroyo of Salyer's Canyon immediately in front of him, just reaching it as his horse fell.\n",
      "Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath, Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank.\n",
      "Bullets were so thick, throwing sand in his face, that he found it difficult to return the fire.\n",
      "Noticing Russell's horse in front of the long log building, he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began working his way down the ditch to join him.\n",
      "Dropping to one knee, Cook felled one, and the other struggled off with his comrade, sending no further fire in his direction.\n",
      "Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed, he did hear shots down at the house.\n",
      "Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised, dismounted, but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him, he fell into the trapper's arms -- dead.\n",
      "Finding him dead, Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.\n",
      "Before daylight Sunday morning, a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves, where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered.\n",
      "The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid.\n",
      "the Mexicans not only refused to give them, but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it.\n",
      "Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated, too small a posse had been collected, and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants, MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw.\n",
      "The posse's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent.\n",
      "During the following week, six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned;;\n",
      "District Attorney M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms -- he just didn't catch anyone.\n",
      "Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico.\n",
      "His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense, perpetuating the troubles.\n",
      "By early summer, he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially, so Pels sent him a draft for $100, warning that it was still not wise for him to return.\n",
      "Pels also sent a check for $100 to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave.\n",
      "They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property, thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo, and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot.\n",
      "Pels complained: `` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business;;\n",
      "nothing accomplished, and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce''.\n",
      "Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales, a man with many followers, including a number who were kept in line through fear of him.\n",
      "When they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby, they smashed down the door, broke the window, and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room.\n",
      "While prowling around these buildings, two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside.\n",
      "He was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out, but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door.\n",
      "The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive.\n",
      "In deadly earnest, the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside, only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor.\n",
      "When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer, taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside, square against the muzzle of a Winchester.\n",
      "Shot near the heart, he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away, three bullets following him.\n",
      "Not realizing the seriousness of the wound, the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him.\n",
      "When the house was about half consumed, his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands, declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel.\n",
      "Finding it true that he was not inside, the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket.\n",
      "Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand.\n",
      "There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who, though numbering in the fifties, had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack.\n",
      "Early the next morning, a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez, one of the posse members, was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper Vermejo.\n",
      "The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed, according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr. I. P. George, and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman.\n",
      "A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking part in the `` murder'' of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger.\n",
      "The men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave.\n",
      "The ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large, and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses, defending themselves through loopholes, it would be most difficult to capture them.\n",
      "Thus he wired J. P. Lower and Sons of Denver: `` Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot??\n",
      "If not, how long to order and what is the price''??\n",
      "He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup, particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard.\n",
      "His problem then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately.\n",
      "The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality, and assessments were made for its maintenance.\n",
      "As new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it.\n",
      "The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center, Depot, and Way's Lane.\n",
      "The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities.\n",
      "There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams.\n",
      "Manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev. J. D. Wickham, headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary, was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse.\n",
      "A message of less than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents.\n",
      "By 1871 L. C. Orvis, manager of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company'', expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore.\n",
      "Orvis even needed to hire an assistant, Clark J. Wait.\n",
      "The line soon lived up to its name, as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock.\n",
      "In 1879 the same Clark Wait, with H. H. Holley of South Dorset, formed the `` American Telegraph Line'', extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset.\n",
      "But companies continued to spring up.\n",
      "Still existing on a `` Northern Union'' telegraph form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J. J. Hapgood to Burton and Graves' store in Manchester -- `` Get and send by stage four pounds best Porterhouse or serloin stake, for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges''.\n",
      "About 1888 J. E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E. G. Bacon became proprietors of the `` Green Mountain Telegraph Company'', connecting all offices on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville to Peru, Londonderry, South Londonderry, Lowell Lake, Windham, North Windham, Grafton, Cambridgeport, Saxton's River, and Bellows Falls.\n",
      "These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not only to play golf, which had come into vogue, but also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments.\n",
      "New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers.\n",
      "During that tournament alone, some 250,000 words winged their way out of Manchester.\n",
      "During summers, business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger.\n",
      "Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk's office and drugstore at the Village.\n",
      "This was extended the following year to include the railroad station agent's office and Thayer's Hotel at Factory Point.\n",
      "In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot.\n",
      "Telephone wires from Louis Dufresne's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895.\n",
      "These must have been for local calls strictly, as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone'' in town was transferred from C. B. Carleton's to Young's shoe store.\n",
      "Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal.\n",
      "In 1918 the New England Telephone Company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U. S. Rte. 7 and what is now Memorial Avenue at Manchester Center.\n",
      "Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason Telephone Company'' in 1925, but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, which eventually gained all control.\n",
      "More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business.\n",
      "In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs, agent and chief operator, who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service, led agency offices in sales for the year with $2,490.\n",
      "In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange, which made business easier for the Manchester office, but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset.\n",
      "electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use.\n",
      "Yet one has to go back only some sixty years.\n",
      "The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin's and Houghton's gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point.\n",
      "No records are available as to the date or extent of installation, but it may have been in 1896.\n",
      "On June 14, 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S. Isham at `` Ormsby Hill''.\n",
      "In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant.\n",
      "Nothing came of it, perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage.\n",
      "At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way, the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery, intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity.\n",
      "For a time following the abandonment of the local plant, electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north.\n",
      "With respect to this view, two points are worth making.\n",
      "First, it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus'', `` gay''.\n",
      "It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus'', `` no less salutary than gay''.\n",
      "It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon, and quite clearly in More's lexicon, the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous, and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn.\n",
      "More believed that a man could be both serious and gay.\n",
      "That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion, sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of.\n",
      "Secondly, to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars, of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed, of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself.\n",
      "But to return to the main line of our inquiry, it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed, it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr.\n",
      "And if he did stand on the margins of modernity, it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom.\n",
      "Had More's writings been wholly limited to such exercises, they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time, whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works.\n",
      "And the evidence that he does, indeed, stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so.\n",
      "Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response??\n",
      "Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there;;\n",
      "we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval, the Renaissance, and the modern.\n",
      "The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More, the author of Utopia, in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More, the martyr.\n",
      "To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism, the Renaissance elements are of primary concern.\n",
      "we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has;;\n",
      "we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia.\n",
      "To that question the answer is simple;;\n",
      "But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials.\n",
      "We find it in Plato's Republic, and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book.\n",
      "We find it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians'', that is, the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity.\n",
      "and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.\n",
      "But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515, it is not communism as such that we are concerned with.\n",
      "we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is, simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia, as More conceived it.\n",
      "Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory.\n",
      "In Plato's Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries.\n",
      "Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass, among whom private ownership prevails, the governing warrior elite.\n",
      "Moreover, it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods, wives, and children, was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche;;\n",
      "and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns.\n",
      "Utopian communism applies to all Utopians.\n",
      "and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering.\n"

      "To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit, the monastic communities, is with an appropriate shift of adjectives, misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic: in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes, in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes.\n",
      "And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors, their spiritual athleticism.\n",

      "During the Brown trial, however, the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper, the Providence Daily Post, stated that Brown was a murderer, a man of blood, and that he and his associates, with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists, had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments.\n",

      "Resolved that, while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects, yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom, we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor.\n",
      "Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas, occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory, call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered, and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice.\n",
      "Resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action.\n",

      "On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes, it could have been avoided completely.\n",
      "Through 1911 and 1912, as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny, the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances.\n",
      "To reinforce, and sometimes to replace, the simulated typography, Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint;;\n",
      "the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas.\n",
      "In certain other pictures, however, Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing.\n",
      "These areas, by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern, stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective;;\n",
      "that is, by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface.\n",
      "The process of flattening seemed inexorable, and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion.\n",
      "It was for this reason, and no other that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper, instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint.\n",
      "Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911, when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas.\n",
      "It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque's, which would confirm the date he assigns it.\n",
      "But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography;;\n",
      "and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910.\n",
      "When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each.\n",
      "( It makes no real difference that Braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal, while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil.\n",
      ") By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done.\n",
      "For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief, which gives way in turn, and with equal immediacy, to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither.\n",
      "Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture, and the device boomerangs: the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before.\n",
      "Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it, the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it, and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture.\n",
      "The actual surface becomes both ground and background, and it turns out -- suddenly and paradoxically -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of, upon, the surface.\n",
      "In their very first collages, Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth, so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real, bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface.\n",
      "In the upper center of Braque's first collage, Fruit Dish( in Douglas Cooper's collection), a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane.\n",
      "The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses, but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it.\n",
      "Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper, and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering, manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump''.\n",
      "At the same time, the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them, and by their placing in relation to the block capitals;;\n",
      "and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing, and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining.\n",
      "and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface.\n",
      "The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface, while something will be drawn, painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth.\n",
      "Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space, and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially.\n",
      "All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it.\n",
      "Flatness may now monopolize everything, but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not, properly speaking, a pictorial illusion.\n",
      "Depicted, Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal, undepicted kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so, moreover, without depriving the latter of its literalness;;\n",
      "rather, it underpins and reinforces that literalness, re-creates it.\n",
      "For it had turned out, by a further paradox of Cubism, that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging.\n",
      "In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it;;\n",
      "they had also had to generalize it -- to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.\n",
      "In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be isolated;;\n",
      "It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation.\n",
      "If they opted for illusion, it could only be illusion per se -- an illusion of depth, and of relief, so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects.\n",
      "If, on the other hand, they opted for representation, it had to be representation per se -- representation as image pure and simple, without connotations( at least, without more than schematic ones) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed.\n",
      "It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become, for the first time, mutually exclusive alternatives.\n",
      ") But the inner, formal logic of Cubism, as it worked itself out through the collage, had just as much to do with shaping their decision.\n",
      "When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to coalesce -- become `` synthesized'' -- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane.\n",
      "and the broad, opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane.\n",
      "Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes, and to the extent that they are flat, they also assert themselves as silhouettes;;\n",
      "and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts( if it does start from a subject).\n",
      "It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is, because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects, or at least parts of them, re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913.\n",
      "Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage, but not conclusively;;\n",
      "Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil, and transformed by this translation, did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, unmistakable three-dimensional identities.\n",
      "this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque, never again to relinquish it.\n",
      "But even before that, Picasso had glimpsed and entered, for a moment, a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him.\n",
      "It was as though, in that instant, he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal three-dimensionality.\n",
      "This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage( and of Cubism in general) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane.\n",
      "to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings, thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane.\n",
      "The affixed elements of collage were extruded, as it were, and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief.\n",

      "The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry, which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor.\n",
      "To light industry, the economies of being on one floor are much slighter, but efficiency engineers usually believe in them, and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers.\n",
      "This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe.\n",
      "The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in Akron, Chrysler's Detroit plants, U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh works -- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city, yet close to transport( river), storage( piers) and power( river).\n",

      "What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing, especially in those cities where public transit is feeble.\n",

      "No suburban shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store.\n",
      "Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are.\n",
      "In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches'' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store.\n",
      "The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical, that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown, and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches.\n",
      "Moreover, the cost of operations is always high in any new store, as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover.\n",
      "Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store, though both are the same distance from home.\n",
      "Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown.\n",
      "Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi, through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping, simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town.\n",
      "To the extent that the problem is merely parking, an aggressive downtown management, like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus, Ohio, can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door.\n",
      "If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems, however, the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program.\n",
      "And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people'', rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store, the central location may be in serious trouble.\n",
      "Today, according to land economist Homer Hoyt, shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land, which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business Districts put together.\n",
      "The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety, both within its gates and across the street, where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind.\n",
      "If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing, it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production), household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items.\n",
      "Department stores were built on dry goods, especially ladies' fashions, and in this area, in the long run, the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown.\n",
      "If this analysis is correct, the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge, marginal operations rather than major factors.\n",

      "Was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree.\n",
      "Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief, they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown.\n",
      "Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change, gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians, is actually upon us.\n",

      "The descent may be remote, but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States.\n",
      "Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole, in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter, at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure.\n",
      "After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco, and slightly less than half the frieze, beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door, and ending with William Penn, all but one leg, when a tragic accident ended his career.\n",
      "He left at his death sketches, drawn to scale, for the rest of the circle.\n",
      "These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini, who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil, in Italian, that he `` began at this point''.\n",
      "Then, advised by the Architect of the Capitol, the Joint Committee for the Library, traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building, ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco, to show `` the Peace after the Civil War'', `` the Spanish-American War'', and `` the Birth of Aviation'', to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition.\n",
      "What follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings, the new frescoing of the gap, and the successive essays in conservation, with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each.\n",
      "It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks, and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation, with a mortar, one part slaked lime, three parts sand, to be put on in two layers.\n",
      "Cartoons were drawn full size, after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities.\n",
      "One had to manage the given subjects, three diverse recent events, so as to make them part of a classical frieze, -- that is, a pattern of large figures filling the space, with not much else, against a blank background.\n",
      "When it was all arranged to fit, and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze, the cartoons were tried in place.\n",
      "and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale.\n",
      "To be sure of matching color as well as form, pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast, and large samples painted in fresco, then left two months to dry out to their final key.\n",
      "Later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.\n",
      "The scaffold was the length of the space to be painted.\n",
      "It could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster, one half inch, and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century, and current in Italy to this day.\n",
      "This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint.\n",
      "In our own practice, to have the last `` intonaco'' plaster coat thick enough to match, and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying, we found that it had to be put on in two layers, letting the first set awhile before applying the second.\n",
      "The mortar was three parts sand to two of lime.\n",
      "Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us;;\n",
      "but to make it stiffer, of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking, we added a little hydrated lime -- hard on the hands, but we could see no other disadvantage.\n",
      "I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting.\n",
      "As it was, it took the pigment well for six hours, enough for our purpose, and held it firmly in setting.\n",
      "It was obvious that to match Brumidi, white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones.\n",
      "Lime white, hard and brilliant, has a tendency to `` jump'' away from the other colors in drying, and also by its capacity to set, to preclude the use of ready-made gradations, so useful in decorative work.\n",
      "For convenience we chose a stronger pigment, unknown to the early Italians or to Brumidi, titanium oxide, reserving the active lime white for highest lights, put on at the end of the day's stint.\n",
      "This last was probably not in Brumidi's palette, but was needed to take the chill, bluish look off the new work next to the old, where softening effects of time were seen, even after thorough cleaning.\n",
      "The use of `` secco'' we tried to restrict to covering joints.\n",
      "Experience showed, however, that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven.\n",
      "We were forced, as they were, to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas.\n",
      "We made it by Doerner's recipe, five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty;;\n",
      "On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group, as it looked after cleaning operations, which had not yet come around to the other end;;\n",
      "One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there, left for our century to finish.\n",
      "Costaggini said it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle.\n",
      "Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's designs, ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own.\n",
      "Whosever fault, it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` histories'' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold.\n",
      "In painting a fresco, the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right, not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering.\n",
      "At the very first, then, Brumidi was required, by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group, to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on Liberty's right, before starting on the allegorical figures themselves.\n",
      "Here he put a small man, whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful, until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning, this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` forty-niners'', and was to hold a basket.\n",
      "The photograph, Figure 1 of the completed frieze, shows how, having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years, he has now been given a hand, and by juxtaposition( and the permission of the Committee), given a new job, to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903.\n",
      "The startlingly bright effect of the first washings led the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them.\n",
      "The fixed wooden scaffold was removed, and, so as to reach all the frieze, one of pipe, on wheels, built up from the floor.\n",
      "Every few days, in the early morning, as the work progressed, twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda pavement, supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting.\n",
      "On this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor, after a first dusting, we began to wash.\n",
      "A most useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a greenhouse `` mist spray'' nozzle welded to a hose connection, to be used at low water pressure.\n",
      "One man sprayed, with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting.\n",
      "In parts a repeated sponging was needed, but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness.\n",
      "No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions.\n",
      "Apparently not more than dusting had ever been done, and not much of that.\n",
      "Here the Architect, referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building, not a museum, requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect, rather than leaving blank, unsightly patches.\n",
      "With naked gas jets below and leaky windows above, enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium, they have survived, in a building long unheated in winter, hot and damp under the iron dome in summer.\n",
      "Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me.\n",
      "It may well be that, when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring, you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked.\n",
      "As American artists, it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible.\n",
      "This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful.\n",
      "Even though we did not see many of your faces, it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard, from those whom we had the fortune to encounter, that we had been in your midst.\n",
      "I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R..\n",
      "I can well understand your curiosity.\n",
      "We, ourselves, are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live.\n",
      "It is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists.\n",
      "There should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter.\n",
      "Pozzatti and I endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes.\n",
      "The time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything I saw.\n",
      "Nevertheless I consider it reasonable, because of my commitment as an artist, to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests.\n",
      "If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view.\n",
      "It is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority, such as artists, in any social order.\n",
      "I encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience.\n",
      "That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction.\n",
      "Apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively, or at least dispassionately, to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments.\n",
      "Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice as well.\n",
      "the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons.\n",
      "Difficult as it may have been at times, Pozzatti and I saw enough, talked to enough artists, historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear.\n",
      "By themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet, but without them there would be very little left worth saving.\n",
      "It cannot be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one.\n",
      "On that cold, but bright, April day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple's celebration for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the Kremlin.\n",
      "If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement, our last day, to us at least, was equally impressive and very moving, even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence.\n",
      "We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor.\n",
      "One had taken a flight into uncharted space, in the service of science, to return as a living hero.\n",
      "The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit.\n",
      "The flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero.\n",
      "These two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which, to me at least, symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism.\n",
      "A struggle that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest.\n",
      "The socialist environment, it was stated, had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit.\n",
      "When I speculated on one such occasion that the new growth, like other mutations, might be unable to propagate, I was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice.\n",
      "I could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are non-propagating mules''.\n",
      "This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to.\n",
      "A chance remark about Lenin's sealed train brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington's cherry tree.\n",
      "Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses.\n",
      "No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence, namely, Cultural Exchange.\n",
      "We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists.\n",
      "Instead, we became involved in a series of friendly, but overly formal, welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind.\n",
      "The terms of friendship, understanding, cooperation, etc., tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use.\n",
      "I can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion.\n",
      "The presiding female functionary, of massive proportions and forbidding appearance, initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts.\n",
      "It was only after we had responded, with what I fear were similar cliches, that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos.\n",
      "She retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there.\n",
      "Unfortunately she returned later, just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia, with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U.S..\n",
      "This gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction.\n",
      "She did not go so far as to say, as was done on other occasions, that Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U.S.S.R.\n",
      "Pozzatti and I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere.\n",
      "We were to discover, in fact, that quite a number of people share with us the impression that, in contrast to other Soviet regions, Moscow's atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official.\n",
      "Until our Moscow experience, I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally.\n",
      "Artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion;;\n",
      "and, furthermore, I could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group.\n",
      "The following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in Leningrad:\n",
      "`` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways.\n",
      "Our presence here should also be considered further, sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer, peaceful ties among all people.\n",
      "We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals.\n",
      "In spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you, we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit.\n",
      "We are acutely aware that yours is a society which, in spite of several wars and many privations, has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world.\n",
      "We have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours.\n",
      "While we, as American artists, believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity, we would be less than honest with you, or ourselves, if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole.\n",
      "In stating this position, we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists.\n",
      "But certainly, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us, but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding.\n",
      "To many of us, this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom.\n",
      "Its scope is as broad as the question: What does it mean to live in modern society??\n",
      "It is a simple matter, for one so disposed, to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends.\n",
      "The thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large and vigorous family -- a motley jumble of discarded objects, some outworn and some that were never useful, some once whole and bright but now chipped and tarnished, some odd pieces whose history no one remembers, here and there a gem, everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users.\n",
      "It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush, and that, after all, is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset.\n",
      "It would be superfluous to build a critique around them.\n",
      "There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist civilization.\n",
      "It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects.\n",
      "Since I have already discussed his moral position, that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages, which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment.\n",
      "I shall first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis, then argue that, granted these weaknesses, he still has much left that is valuable, and, finally, raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation.\n",
      "What is missing is work that would answer, presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type attitude scales, such questions as these: What are the components of the feeling-state described as alienation??\n",
      "Until such work is done, there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual, who, rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society, projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen.\n",
      "I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work.\n",
      "Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual.\n",
      "I am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in, any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations.\n",
      "The broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed, but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support, has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference, and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area.\n",
      "Another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three times.\n",
      "He concludes that these data show a `` remarkably high'' percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers.\n",
      "Starting from other value premises than Fromm's, some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all, while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low.\n",
      "Eric Hoffer, for example, once said that America was a paradise -- the only one in the history of the world -- for workingmen and small children.\n",
      "What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible, it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied.\n",
      "Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945, in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work, while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount.\n",
      "Fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread.\n",
      "That is one way to read the findings, but again there are other ways.\n",
      "One might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory, an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation.\n",
      "Or, he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all, the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount;;\n",
      "`` Are people happy, are they as satisfied, unconsciously, as they believe themselves to be??\n",
      "He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways.\n",
      "That is, sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery, and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent.\n",
      "The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader.\n",
      "It also permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings.\n",
      "When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category, for example, it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it.\n",
      ") Starting from this, and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society, it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread, stated worker satisfaction, rather than widespread, stated worker dissatisfaction.\n",
      "The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations, and which rests on certain ethical absolutes, empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment.\n",
      "Thus, in the example cited above Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously, unknowingly, of fulfillment, and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious, experienced frustrations.\n",
      "This sort of manipulation is especially troublesome in Fromm's work because, although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions, he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room.\n",
      "The final example of the failure to use available evidence, though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered, comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes.\n",
      "In a brief chapter dealing with `` Various Other Diagnoses'', he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own, and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth.\n",
      "'' He finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century''.\n",
      "It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes.\n",
      "One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear.\n",
      "The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that.\n",
      "It is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.\n",
      "It is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism, for it makes diagnosis and prescription much easier than they might otherwise be.\n",
      "In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera;;\n",
      "such composers as Monteverdi, Lully and Purcell, with the same goal in mind, had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages.\n",
      "Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra, he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence, but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words.\n",
      "The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense, come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing, as in folk songs and liturgical chants.\n",
      "Even then, the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance.\n",
      "Aside from Boris himself, one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture.\n",
      "Pimen is an old man, weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full forte -- but firm and clear of mind.\n",
      "His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement.\n",
      "This theme comes to represent the outer world, the realm of battles and banquets -- seen from a distance, quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery.\n",
      "It changes and develops according to the text;;\n",
      "Once he has been identified, however, a new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect:\n",
      "The original D minor seems to symbolize blindness, inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it.\n",
      "As the child addresses the shepherd in a dream, light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear, and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining D major.\n",
      "Varlaam and Missail always appear together and often sing together, in a straightforward, rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated Pimen.\n",
      "The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene.\n",
      "Apparently their origin is humble, their approach to life direct and unsophisticated.\n",
      "A rough ostinato figure, heard first in the introduction to the inn scene, characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action:\n",
      "Varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together when the need arises.\n",
      "Both monks respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song;;\n",

      "For the only time in the opera, words are not set according to their natural inflection;;\n",
      "to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.\n",
      "His music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's Hoffman.\n",
      "Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it.\n",
      "He speaks quietly, concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility, just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them.\n",
      "it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name, placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father.\n"

      "Curiously, this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time, the scene between Amonasro and Aida.\n",

      "Another theme, sinuously chromatic, appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori by any means, even at the cost of her honor.\n",
      "Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.\n",

      "So far these remarks, like most criticisms of Hardy, have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece, one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development.\n",
      "This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet: `` Domicilium'' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860'';;\n",
      "One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years, some changes in style and method would have occurred, some development taken place.\n",
      "This is not, however, the case, and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense.\n",
      "In a time when poetic style, and poetic belief as well, seem in a state of continual flux, Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency.\n",
      "the `` sober opinion'' of his letter to Noyes, written when Hardy was eighty years old, is essentially that of his first `` philosophical'' notebook entry, made when he was twenty-five: `` The world does not despise us: it only neglects us''( Early Life, p. 63).\n",
      "so that, while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy, it is difficult to date one.\n",
      "There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his.\n",
      "There is only one Hardy style, but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident, and when it is not, the style is the style of another poet, or of the fashion of the time.\n",
      "These dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems, since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other.\n",
      "From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry, always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative.\n",
      "The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant, his production was not.\n",
      "He had two productive periods, one in the late 1860's, the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920( half of the dated poems are from the latter period, and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's poems).\n",
      "There was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between 1872 and 1882 and, except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in 1887, very few from 1882 to 1890.\n",
      "The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes, and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time.\n",
      "the former contains no poem dated before 1909- 10 -- that is, no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such.\n",
      "The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation, before he had decided to write fiction for a living( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865- 1868;;\n",
      "During the poetically sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was, in addition, burdened with bad health( he spent six months in bed in 1881, too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A Laodicean).\n",
      "Two entries in The Early Life support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry.\n",
      "Mrs. Hardy records that `` at the end of November( 1881) he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible''( Early Life, p. 188);;\n",
      "and on Christmas Day, 1890, Hardy wrote: `` While thinking of resuming' the viewless Wings Of Poesy before dawn this morning, new horizons seemed to open, and worrying pettinesses to disappear''( Early Life, p. 302).\n",
      "The second productive period, the decade from 1910 to 1920, can be related to three events: the completion of The Dynasts in 1909, which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years;;\n",
      "It may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies, but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen, a youth till he was five-and-twenty, and a young man till he was nearly fifty''( Early Life, p. 42).\n",
      "We may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers, wanting only the impetus of two tragedies, one personal, the other national, to loose those powers in poetry.\n",
      "Hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years, yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a narrowing, not an expanding process.\n",
      "Like a wise gardener, Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian sonnets and songs, and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited, and let the main stock of his talent flourish.\n",
      "There is not much to be said for `` Revulsion''.\n",
      "it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form, but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy.\n",
      "there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem.\n",
      "it asserts emotion without evoking it -- that is to say, it is sentimental.\n",
      "`` Neutral Tones'' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial language, the hard, particular, colorless images, the slightly odd stanza-form, the dramatic handling of the occasion, the refusal to resolve the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems.\n",
      "The details of the setting of `` Neutral Tones'' are not, strictly speaking, metaphorical, but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love, and in this way love and weather, the emotions and the elements, symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems( `` Weathers'', `` The Darkling Thrush'', and `` During Wind and Rain'', for example) and to some moving passages in the novels as well( Far From The Madding Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way).\n",
      "I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older( as Yeats did), but that he simply learned to use better what he already had.\n",
      "if it is somber, it is also precise, and the precision lends authority to the vision.\n",
      "the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's right to speak as he does.\n",
      "they compose a painful elegy to what might have been, to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness, and ended in long years of suffering and hatred.\n",
      "Hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private;;\n",
      "he sometimes called them `` an expiation'', and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals.\n",
      "They are the only poems that he rearranged as a group between their first appearance( in Satires Of Circumstance) and the publication of the Collected Poems.\n",
      "The elegiac tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice, and it is not surprising that the 1912- 13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his.\n",
      "but the mood is not quite nostalgic -- Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past, and the eternal deadness of the dead.\n",
      "Like the pillars of Hercules, like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles, stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation: the great saxophonist, Charlie Parker, and Dylan Thomas.\n",
      "Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves, because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art.\n",
      "Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue.\n",
      "The last time I saw Bird, at Jimbo's Bob City, he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there.\n",
      "I said, referring to the pretentious `` Jazz Concert''.\n",
      "About dawn he got up to blow.\n",
      "Music, of course, is not so explicit an art, but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift.\n",
      "It is the theme of Horace, who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas.\n",
      "The difference is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance.\n",
      "I do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity.\n",
      "I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value.\n",
      "Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews.\n",
      "He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens.\n",
      "As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven, I believe his art became meaningless to him.\n",
      "I think all this could apply to Parker just as well, although, because of the nature of music, it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively.\n",
      "Contrary to popular belief, they were not great technical innovators.\n",
      "Similarly, the innovations of bop, and of Parker particularly, have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music, especially by that ignoramus, the intellectual jitterbug, the jazz aficionado.\n",
      "What Parker and his contemporaries -- Gillespie, Davis, Monk, Roach( Tristano is an anomaly), etc. -- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure, of which it then became an integral part, and with which it then developed.\n",
      "It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously, or at least is continuously sprung, so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe.\n",
      "This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music.\n",
      "It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry.\n",
      "Again, contrary to popular belief, there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically or emotionally.\n",
      "Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication.\n",
      "Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world.\n",
      "Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world.\n",
      "Technique pure and simple, rendition, is not of major importance, but it is interesting that Parker, following Lester Young, was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution.\n",
      "Metrically, Thomas's verse was extremely conventional, as was, incidentally, the verse of that other tragic enrage, Hart Crane.\n",
      "I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts.\n",
      "Confabulation has come to determine structure.\n",
      "Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like Allen Tate, for instance, to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities of an Apollinaire, let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense -- so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed.\n",
      "In fact, his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham, who seems to have imitated him without much understanding, and who has since moved on to other methods.\n",
      "Thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now extinct British romantic school of the New Apocalypse -- Henry Treece, J. F. Hendry, and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets.\n",
      "At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in America to blow like Bird.\n",
      "Even before his death this influence had begun to ebb.\n",
      "The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them.\n",
      "The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant, idiosyncratic.\n",
      "There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard, or for that matter, from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein.\n",
      "The cubist generation before World War 1,, and, on a lower level, the surrealists of the period between the wars, both assumed an accepted universe of discourse, in which, to quote Andre Breton, it was possible to make definite advances, exactly as in the sciences.\n",
      "But it is obvious that they were self-deluded.\n",
      "It is curious that at its best, the work of this school of painting -- Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Willem De-Kooning, and the rest -- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters: the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee, itself a formula derived from Renoir;;\n",
      "You have only to compare such painting with the work of, say, Sesshu, to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.\n",
      "Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with Tiepolo, where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power.\n",
      "In fact, once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall, it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper.\n",
      "There is just more to Tiepolo.\n",
      "Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter, there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition.\n",
      "That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey, at least, is hard to deny.\n",
      "Milman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic, and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived;;\n",
      "he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition, and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas.\n",
      "Proceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata, Francis P. Magoun, Jr., argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations, and the thesis is striking and compelling.\n",
      "Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.\n",
      "The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet, but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty, even in a language of many terminal inflections.\n",
      "Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb, although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings.\n",
      "the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood.\n",
      "Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage, it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition.\n",
      "Either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines, because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns.\n",
      "Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction, but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents, and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language.\n",
      "Limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic dialects, we cannot say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil.\n",
      "But we can say that since a writing poet, with leisure before him, would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution, the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition.\n",
      "One of the greatest Homerists of our time, Frederick M. Combellack, argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems, the postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing.\n",
      "Any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen.\n",
      "The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success;;\n",
      "no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man;;\n",
      "no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ.\n",
      "This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well.\n",
      "To the extent that a tale is twice told, its final author must be suspect, although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi.\n",
      "Combellack argues further, and here he makes his main point, that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry, Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable.\n",
      "With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions, no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context, because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow.\n",
      "Words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers, sometimes accurate and sometimes not.\n",
      "This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry.\n",
      "To the extent that a language is formulaic, its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches.\n",
      "W. F. Bryan suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness, but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic.\n",
      "If the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional, he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements.\n",
      "Once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity, they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts.\n",
      "It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony.\n",
      "A long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things, and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate.\n",
      "True, we do not know how they were regarded in their day, but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases.\n",
      "Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem;;\n",
      "no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam.\n",
      "In Coriolanus the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly, but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent''.\n",
      "The poet's intentions are difficult to discern and, except to biographers, unimportant;;\n",
      "Albert B. Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild, and Magoun argues that the Beowulf poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion.\n",
      "This explanation is attractive, but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that Cynewulf, though he used kennings in the traditional manner, was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works.\n",
      "In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard, one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited, and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing, and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past.\n",
      "Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory: Beowulf may contain a design for terror, and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery.\n",
      "The account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly, however, upon the degree to which they were formulaic.\n",
      "Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems, and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times.\n",
      "Thus one line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems.\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition;;\n",
      "there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague.\n",
      "In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle, however, to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety, for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs.\n",
      "The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets;;\n",
      "Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content, to show, as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally, that much of the novel's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor''.\n",
      "J. H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective.\n",
      "In his analysis, however, he touches upon but fails to explore an idea, generally neglected in discussions of the book, which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative.\n",
      "This essay seeks to make that exploration.\n",
      "He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre, gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response.\n",
      "It is hardly accidental, therefore, that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands.\n",
      "Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger, a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates, half terrifies all who have dealings with him.\n",
      "Old Mr. Pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless, social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair'' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it'', whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose''.\n",
      "Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark, were it not that in Great Expectations, as in no other of Dickens' novels, hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them.\n",
      "Dickens not only reveals character through gesture, he makes hands a crucial element of the plot, a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters, and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt, pursuit, crime, greed, education, materialism, enslavement( by both people and institutions), friendship, romantic love, forgiveness, and redemption.\n",
      "We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke's famous story, `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole'', to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment.\n",
      "So it is with Great Expectations, whether the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery or Pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry.\n",
      "Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel, but, on a deeper plane, they relate to the themes of sin, guilt, and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics.\n",
      "The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on'' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in''.\n",
      "Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open'', `` imbruing his hands'' in him.\n",
      "As Pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed, his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost, transforming it into `` a phantom devoting me to the Hulks''.\n",
      "Held upside down in the graveyard, Pip clings in terror `` with both hands'' to his convict;;\n",
      "later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending.\n",
      "Through such details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives.\n",
      "Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds, hands naturally represent action, and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it, the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at.\n",
      "Orlick slouches about the forge `` like Cain'' with `` his hands in his pockets'', and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday, she claps her hands in a tantrum, beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees'', and clenches them in her husband's hair.\n",
      "This last `` rampage'' is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head, `` dealt by some unknown hand'' whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action -- the tracing of Orlick's hammer upon a slate.\n",
      "Pip himself is to feel the terror of Orlick's `` murderous hand'' in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes.\n",
      "Orlick shakes his hand at Pip, bangs the table with his fist, draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered'' for his victim, lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides'', and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers''.\n",
      "The scarred, disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past, for her master, coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests, makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands''.\n",
      "Jaggers' iron control over her( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back)'') rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails.\n",
      "It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting'') that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House.\n",
      "Finally, Magwitch's pursuit of Compeyson, his archenemy and betrayer, begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his `` laying his hand on his cloak to identify him'', thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which Compeyson drowns.\n",
      "Money, so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens, is here central, and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- acquisitiveness, snobbery, self-interest, hypocrisy, toadyism, irresponsibility, injustice -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth.\n",
      "Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle'', who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence''.\n",
      "Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands, roughened by work in the smithy, and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work, artificiality and naturalness, gentility and commonness, coldness and affection -- in fact, between Satis House and the forge.\n",
      "When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love, the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims: `` No, don't wipe it off -- for God's sake, give me your blackened hand''!!\n",
      "Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham, during which he kneels to kiss her hand, signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour;;\n",
      "when, on the journey to London that immediately follows, he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village, the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity.\n",
      "Incidentally, one cannot miss the significance of this gesture, for Dickens reintroduces it associatively in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition, in a talk with Herbert Pocket, that his hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic.\n",
      "The vulture-like attendance of the Pocket family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket, who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking, then lays it `` upon her heaving bosom'' with `` an unnatural fortitude of manner'', and finally kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward Estella.\n",
      "Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement.\n",
      "We first see him shaking Mrs. Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands `` for the hundredth time at least''( `` May I -- may I --''??\n",
      ") in effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations.\n",
      "Pip first learns `` the stupendous power of money'' from the sycophantic tailor, Mr. Trabb, whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer, and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow'' and `` rub'' Pip out of the shop.\n",
      "The respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette, and, upon taking up the life of a London gentleman, Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under''.\n",
      "The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items: channel, unit, combined channel and unit, combined arm and file, unit record synchronizers, inquiry synchronizers, and alteration switches.\n",

      "Less severe thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes.\n",
      "It furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats.\n",

      "For radiosterilization, to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about 4.5 Mrad for nonacid foods of low salt content.\n",
      "For radiopasteurization, to partially destroy microorganisms;;\n",
      "results vary with types of food, storage conditions, and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of 0.2 Mrads but up to about 0.8 Aj.\n",
      "For inhibiting the sprouting of root vegetables -- 4,000 to 10,000 Aj.\n",
      "Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects, particularly at the higher radiation dosages.\n",
      "In this respect, the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has, to date, been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods.\n",
      "for example, gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or collimated, whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated.\n",
      "Estimated production costs of radiation energy from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per Aj.\n",
      "Radiation, therefore, is at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization.\n",
      "It has been estimated that for applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for gamma radiation generated in a reactor core.\n",
      "Because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically, and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location, the use of large central processing stations, where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized, is inherently impracticable.\n",
      "The objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time.\n",
      "They require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration, preferably items already cooked and ready to eat.\n",
      "Thus, food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability.\n",
      "Of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast pork, after radiosterilization, is superior in palatability to available canned pork products.\n",
      "A prime objective of the Army Quartermaster Corps program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means of overcoming it, since it is a major and desirable dietary item.\n",
      "Partly because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization, treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat.\n",
      "Moderate radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 rads can extend the shelf life( at 35 F) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks.\n",
      "Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration, and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities.\n",
      "The principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen.\n",
      "Costs of canning meat are in the range of 0.8 to 5 cents per pound;;\n",
      "costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to 3.5 cents per pound.\n",
      "Under the conditions of comparison, it will be noted that:( 1)\n",
      "Radiopasteurization has also been successful, and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product.\n",
      "Acceptance of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed, however, for two reasons:( 1) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices, and( 2) treatment by antibiotics, a measure already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 cents per pound.\n",
      "Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products, substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately.\n",
      "The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard, sharp, tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating.\n",
      "The force required to accomplish removal is plotted, by means of an electronic recorder, against distance of removal.\n",
      "Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness, a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness.\n",
      "A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals, glass, wood, and plastic surfaces.\n",
      "Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests.\n",
      "As the coating becomes thicker, the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure.\n",
      "It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating.\n",
      "The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface.\n",
      "The pictures of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at, or close to, the interface between coating and substrate.\n",
      "If the force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness, a graph as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5 may characteristically result.\n",
      "Here, H is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and T is the film thickness.\n",
      "It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal.\n",
      "Also, it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response, while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature.\n",
      "It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness.\n",
      "What then, are the factors that contribute to these phenomena??\n",
      "Why should the `` practical adhesion'' of a coating as assessed by a knife method change, initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness??\n",
      "It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure.\n",
      "Af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate.\n",
      "An analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle **yc and the friction angle **yt determine the vector direction Af of the force resultants R and Af.\n",
      "Consequently, both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process.\n",
      "It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly.\n",
      "In actual practice, the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force Af and the shear angle Aj.\n",
      "These two values and the rake angle **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships.\n",
      "One of these is the fact that the knife employed, no matter how well sharpened, will have a slightly rounded cutting edge.\n",
      "This signifies that **yc, the rake angle, is no longer a constant to zero film thickness.\n",
      "The curvature of this bluntness is, in the case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer, determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil..\n",
      "The force vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also.\n",
      "Because the rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller( or even negative) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife, a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result.\n",
      "This reduces to the relationship: Af, where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn.( 1), Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife tip, Af is a straight line first approximation of this roundness, and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn.( 1).\n",
      "It can be seen that Af is a constant, and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife.\n",
      "Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af.\n",
      "The resultant friction force, Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness.\n",
      "Since the load L, under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af, it can be seen that Af\n",
      "The measured force, H, in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating, Af, that due to the bluntness of the knife, Af, and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate, Af, or Af.\n",
      "These theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism.\n",
      "The basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture, rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane.\n",
      "The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by Merchant for metal cutting, and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings.\n",
      "In the first picture( 9a) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation.\n",
      "In the next, the shear plane angle is high, and extends to the inclined work surface.\n",
      "With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases.\n",
      "Merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used.\n",
      "If the rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle **yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af, the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate.\n",
      "Within only a few years, foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral, and important, phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight.\n",
      "And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated.\n",
      "As this issue goes to press, for example, one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength;;\n",
      "another reports that a cellular polypropylene, primarily for use in wire coating applications, is being investigated.\n",
      "On the following pages, each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail, as to properties, applications, and methods of processing.\n",
      "It might be well to point out, however, some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved.\n",
      "Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets.\n",
      "In one outstanding example, Whirlpool Corp. found that by switching to urethane foam insulation, they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models.\n",
      "And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining, new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed.\n",
      "New techniques for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications, including picnic chests, beverage coolers, flower pots, and flotation-type swimming toys.\n",
      "Two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable styrene's growth during the year were packaging( molded inserts replacing complicated cardboard units) and foamed-core building panels.\n",
      "Extruded expandable styrene film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive price-wise with paper -- also showed much potential, particularly for packaging.\n",
      "Sandwich panels for building utility shelters that consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction field.\n",
      "Better `` hand'', a more luxurious feel, and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result.\n",
      "Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent.\n",
      "Readers interested in additional information on foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing in the Technical Data section and to the list of references which appears below.\n",
      "Present estimates are that production topped the 100-million-lb. mark in 1960( 85 to 90 million lb. for flexible, 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid);;\n",
      "by 1965, production may range from 200 to 350 million lb. for flexible and from 115 to 150 million lb. for rigid.\n",
      "The markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations.\n",
      "The most important factor in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production.\n",
      "The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning.\n",
      "Although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method, today, thanks to new catalysts, they can be produced by a one-shot technique.\n",
      "It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours and with superior properties to latex foam.\n",
      "Basically, this means that simpler processing equipment( the mixture has good flowing characteristics) and less external heat( the foaming reaction is exothermic and develops internal heat) are required in one-shot foaming, although, at the same time, the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones.\n",
      "Graph in Fig. 1, p. 392, indicates how the ratio of compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased.\n",
      "By varying the formula, this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression strength/ density ratio.\n",
      "In flexible urethane foams, we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials' primary performance remains functionally useful.\n",
      "In temperature resistance, this quality is usually related to specific properties, e.g., flexural, tensile strengths, etc..\n",
      "Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous, air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition.\n",
      "The K factor, a term used to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material( B.t.u./sq. ft. of material/hr./*0F./in. of thickness) ranges from 0.24 to 0.28 for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12 to 0.16 for rigid urethane foams, depending upon the formulation, density, cell size, and nature of blowing agents used.\n",
      "This term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending.\n",
      "Note that flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density, nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another.\n",
      "Where flexural strength is an important factor, be sure that your urethane foam processor is aware of it.\n",
      "This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart.\n",
      "( like compression strength of urethane foams, it has a direct relationship to formulation.\n",

      "The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape, it can be molded, it can be poured-in-place, it can be applied by spray guns, etc..\n",
      "Basically, the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units, a variable mixer, a nozzle carriage assembly, and, in many cases, a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam.\n",
      "It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure, the material can be cut into lengths as desired.\n",
      "Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finished products.\n",
      "Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine, triangle, trapezoid, and other profiles in variable heights, dimensions, etc..\n",
      "The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically.\n",
      "Also available is a slitter which `` peels'' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd. in length, down to 1/16 in. thick.\n",
      "The low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes, dimensions, and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners, materials handling containers, packaging and cushioning devices, and such novelties as soap dishes, toys, head rests, arch supports, and gas pedal covers.\n",
      "Although slab stock appeared first, it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes, crowned contours, or rounded edges, the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process.\n",
      "Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market.\n",
      "The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems, aided by the development of new catalysts, helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding.\n",
      "While there are still many bugs to be ironed out, the technique is fast developing.\n",
      "Simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured, pumped, etc., into a void where they foam up to fill the void.\n",
      "In a typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig.\n",

      "Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the washing, 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F( 32*0C.) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs, 4 liters to each tub.\n",
      "This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes.\n",
      "At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge.\n",
      "When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs.\n",
      "By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages, first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water, since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains.\n",
      "This method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition.\n",

      "For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces, and assuming Af, we obtain Af percent.\n",
      "This value may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a( very thin) glass layer of index 1.5.\n",
      "It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further.\n",
      "The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed, cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface.\n",
      "This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections.\n",
      "For circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array, the packing efficiency is given by: Af where Af, and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon.\n",
      "It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a( mica) membrane, in addition to an optical output lens system.\n",
      "Thus, the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates( with a combined efficiency of 0.25) is 0.043 or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates.\n",
      "Including the brightness gain Af due to the Af area demagnification, the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is: Af.\n",
      "It is obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes Af for a given input E( in the case of the second stage, for the first phosphor screen emission) is very important.\n",
      "The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen.\n",
      "It has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification.\n",
      "( The P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray fluorescent screens).\n",
      "The following table( 14-2) lists the( luminous) gain values computed according to Eq.( 6) with Af.\n",
      "It is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels.\n",
      "A resolution of 70- 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible.\n",
      "It should be noted that photoluminescence, due to `` Bremsstrahlung'' generated within the viewing screen by electron impact, appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 KV are utilized.\n",
      "It has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 Af at high voltage values of approximately 20 Aj.\n",
      "There are thus three components to an optimal design problem:( 1)\n",
      "For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied;;\n",
      "He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process, the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage, if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process.\n",
      "Proceeding in this way, from one to two and from two to three stages, we may gradually build up the policy for any number.\n",
      "To see how important this economy is, let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables;;\n",
      "To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation;;\n",
      "If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously, Af operations would be required to do the same job, and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program.\n",
      "But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy, namely, that for the given feed state and R stages.\n",
      "If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states, Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search.\n",
      "No optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result.\n",
      "Suppose that Af, and that the average operation requires only Af sec..\n",
      "`` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision''.\n",
      "This is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation.\n",
      "It appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer.\n",
      "At the same time, every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value, and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end.\n",
      "These will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream, so that stage R is the T stage from the end.\n",
      "Thus Af denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process, and Af the state of the product from the last stage.\n",
      "Each stage transforms the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af.\n",
      "In practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions, and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S.\n",
      "The set of vectors Af constitutes the operating policy or, more briefly, the policy, and a policy is admissible if all the Af belong to S.\n",
      "The objective function, which is to be maximized, is some function, usually piecewise continuous, of the product state.\n",
      "When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af.\n",
      "This is the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which, according to the principle of optimality, must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to this state.\n",
      "Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af, and Af is related to Af by( 5).\n",
      "The set of equations( 5),( 6), and the starting equation( 7) is of a recursive type well suited to programming on the digital computer.\n",
      "In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages, only the function Af is needed.\n",
      "To extract the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af, we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function.\n",
      "Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to Af, we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af.\n",
      "It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af, as when the cost of the operating policy is considered.\n",
      "A moment's reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case.\n",
      "A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af.\n",
      "Hence P is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation, that is, the net profit.\n",
      "This sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit, i.e., Af.\n",
      "In this case the stage R operating with conditions Af transforms the state of the stream from Af to Af, but only the probability distribution of Af is known.\n",
      "This is specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af.\n",
      "If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next, then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first.\n",
      "The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here, except that now the fourth column is redundant.\n",
      "The third column gives the optimal policy, but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state.\n",
      "The discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter.\n",
      "In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages, since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process.\n",
      "it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process.\n",
      "A gyro-stabilized platform system, using restrained gyros, is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination.\n",
      "Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis, the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj.\n",
      "It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes.\n",
      "In the system shown in Fig. 7-1, the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer.\n",
      "This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the **yf axis, since the response to Af.\n",
      "If the polarities are correct, the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero.\n",
      "As the accelerometer output is decreasing, the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and, therefore, the rate decreases.\n",
      "The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af.\n",
      "The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain.\n",
      "In addition, the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain;;\n",
      "i.e., high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations.\n",
      "It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration.\n",
      "The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af.\n",
      "When the system is arranged for automatic leveling, the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers.\n",
      "There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts, engine noise, turbulence around the vehicle, etc..\n",
      "One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters.\n",
      "This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt.\n",
      "The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level.\n",
      "Below this level, the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value, in order to provide adequate noise filtering.\n",
      "The effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level, at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process.\n",
      "The platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output, when amplified by Af, will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift.\n",
      "The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros.\n",
      "A useful by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level.\n",
      "The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above.\n",
      "If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling, it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs( this also minimizes the noise problem).\n",
      "However, skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy.\n",
      "Also, it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach.\n",
      "The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled.\n",
      "Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator.\n",
      "In simpler terms, it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction.\n",
      "For purely inertial navigators, two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading: Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading;;\n",
      "The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements, field conditions, and the time available to accomplish the heading.\n",
      "A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit.\n",
      "A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north.\n",
      "This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques.\n",
      "The sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light, which is darkened by crossed hairs, on the accelerometer mirror.\n",
      "The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers.\n",
      "However, this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work.\n",
      "With this situation, it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment.\n",
      "If the platform is not too high off the ground, a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform.\n",
      "This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading.\n",
      "The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer.\n",
      "Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Z-axis gyro.\n",
      "If the Z gyro is drifting, a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift.\n",
      "If the drift error is systematic, it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current.\n",
      "It is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff, which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform.\n",
      "Essentially, the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction, and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero.\n",
      "Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading.\n",
      "For the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros, a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point, and the Y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point.\n",
      "The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers.\n",
      "The platform is leveled and properly headed, so that the X-gyro input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the Y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction.\n",
      "The input axis of the X gyro, when pointing in the east-west direction, is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth.\n",
      "The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading.\n",
      "The earth is spinning at an angular velocity **zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr..\n",
      "Since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space, an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating( with respect to the earth).\n",
      "Scotty did not go back to school.\n",
      "His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off, spend a lot of time in bed and, for the rest, do pretty much as he chose -- provided, of course, he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating.\n",
      "His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that, if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home, there was little danger of his losing a term.\n",
      "Teachers -- men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel.\n",
      "His father tried to make the food a topic.\n",
      "Scotty murmured, `` No, thanks'', so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him.\n",
      "Rachel had little to say.\n",
      "Mr. McKinley, for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity, was completely alert to his son, eyes always on the still face, jumping to anticipate Scotty's desires.\n",
      "Rachel said, `` I'd better get him to bed''.\n",
      "Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture, Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth.\n",
      "Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat.\n",
      "He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel.\n",
      "Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits, cookies, candies -- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen.\n",
      "Try to get that down''.\n",

      "Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now, as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere.\n",
      "Both watched Scotty constantly, Rachel without seeming to, Virginia openly, her eyes filled with concern.\n",
      "He was able, now, to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving.\n",
      "When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable, he would answer;;\n",
      "if, as often happened, he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly, he would repeat his words in the same way, without emphasis or impatience, only a little louder.\n",
      "She said, `` I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit''.\n",
      "He thought about it briefly, then deliberately turned the talk to something else.\n",
      "He thought he saw -- it awakened and, for a moment, interested him -- that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash.\n",
      "The doctor, since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him, came often and informally to the house.\n",
      "He would sit, slim-waisted and spare, on the edge of Scotty's bed, his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor.\n",
      "Scotty did not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing as he used to.\n",
      "`` I don't go to school any more''.\n",
      "The doctor had to bend close to hear;;\n",
      "He turned unsmilingly to Rachel.\n",
      "He had no desire to.\n",
      "You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble.\n",
      "She wants to pay you a visit.\n",
      "Rachel came close to the bed, bent as if she would kiss him, then moved away.\n",
      "She seemed to speak to herself.\n",
      "She turned to him again.\n",
      "It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father.\n",
      "Scotty would reply softly and his father, apologetically, would ask him to repeat.\n",
      "`` I'm not supposed to yet''.\n",
      "Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care, seeking something material to blame for his son's illness.\n",
      "And another time, without accusation: `` You never wore that scarf I bought you''.\n",
      "`` Our objective'', the colonel had said that day of the briefing, `` is Papa-san''.\n",
      "At the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children's hoops, stopped simultaneously, weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again.\n",
      "Smiling at his quixotic thoughts, Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down.\n",
      "If he were to go with White, he would be out there two days, not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san, but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself.\n",
      "He hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think, so many lulls.\n",
      "Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told, that combat was an intermittent activity.\n",

      "When he was in the war, he was in Law or Supplies or something like that, and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals -- just like the one we sent in for Trig -- and go away with a real glow.\n",

      "He must mentally pull the blinds and close the window, so that all that existed was in the books before him.\n",
      "More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York.\n",
      "He had dared to defy nature, to turn his back to the Lorelei, and he was punished.\n",
      "Like Mrs. Dalloway, with her regrets about Peter Walsh, he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent.\n",

      "Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic, hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear.\n",
      "Therefore, he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view.\n",
      "He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing, as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind.\n",
      "He observed the Florentine vase in the hall, the Renoir painting in the library, as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes;;\n",
      "He said to the Secretary, `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre.\n",

      "How best to destroy your peace??\n",
      "At the same time, you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics.\n",

      "A fellow came up to me, a Senator, I don't have to tell you his name, and he told me,' I love the President like a brother, but God damn it, he's crucifying me.\n",
      "I've got a quarter of a million Germans in my state, and those krautheads tune in on Father Werther every night, and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square, that's what they do.\n",
      "He's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany.\n",

      "Literally, there was nothing else to do.\n",
      "Then they went down to Black Bottom.\n",
      "A knot of old worshippers, chiefly women, listened weekly to a sermon.\n",
      "It began invariably in low tones, almost conversational, and then gradually worked up to high, shrill appeals to God and man.\n",
      "And then the Amen corner took hold, re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus, spreading down through the African forest, overseas to the West Indies, and then here in Alabama.\n",
      "With shout and slow dance, with tears and song, with scream and contortion, the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering, wailing, shouting, possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force.\n",
      "It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion.\n",
      "To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience, something for which they lived from week to week.\n",
      "He had preached a short sermon, trying to talk man-to-man to the audience, to tell them who he was, what he had done in Macon and Birmingham, and what he proposed to do here.\n",
      "But then, at mention of that name, the Amen corner broke loose.\n",
      "He had no chance to say another word.\n",
      "The audience did not think much of the new pastor, and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say.\n",
      "First of all there was the parsonage, an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in, originally poorly conceived, apparently not repaired for years, with no plumbing or sewage, with rat-holes and rot.\n",
      "It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church, a woman named Catt who, as Wilson afterward found, was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative.\n",
      "Ann Catt was a lonely, devoted soul, never married, conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church, but a perpetual dissenter and born critic.\n",
      "Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500, but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing.\n",
      "It really ought to be rebuilt, and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the city itself should be talked to.\n",
      "The children had nowhere to go and no place to play, not even sidewalks.\n",
      "There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church, one white, that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes;;\n",
      "Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people, which seemed to him rather queer.\n",
      "Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom??\n",
      "He was glad to have it there.\n",
      "After looking about a bit, Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom, across the river and far removed from the white city, a considerable tract of land, and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot.\n",
      "He talked about it to the Presiding Elder.\n",
      "But there was one thing that he had to stress, and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses, the dollar money, had been seriously falling behind in this church, and that must be looked after immediately.\n",
      "In fact, he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here -- to make a larger contribution of dollar money.\n",
      "Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was, they must have a better church, a more business-like conduct of the church organization, and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization.\n",
      "He emphasized to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river.\n",
      "The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible.\n",
      "But he told Wilson to `` go ahead and try''.\n",
      "The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears, and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in, and that none would be sold to colored folk.\n",
      "When it was proposed to rebuild the church, Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high.\n",
      "He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed.\n",
      "But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board, he met unanimous opposition.\n",
      "It was going to stay forever.\n",
      "It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject.\n",
      "As for rebuilding, well, that might be looked into, but there was no hurry, no hurry at all.\n",
      "Wilson again went downtown to a different banker, an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic, but he shook his head.\n",
      "Don't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church??\n",
      "Now, if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years.\n",
      "By that time, perhaps something better can be done''.\n",
      "I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here''.\n",
      "You'll have to find out about it on your own.\n",
      "Hope to see you again''.\n",
      "It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand.\n",
      "`` Talk to Mrs. Catt'', she said.\n",
      "And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others, he was absolutely amazed.\n",
      "This, of course, was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities -- putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly.\n",
      "And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go.\n",
      "And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church, if not in all churches.\n",
      "Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold.\n",
      "The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi.\n",
      "If their schedules were to synchronize, there was no point in wasting time.\n",
      "He explained his errand, but without bothering much to make it plausible, for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army.\n",
      "He did not really want to kill, but as in the sexual act, there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed, even while you watched yourself giving way to it.\n",
      "He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.\n",
      "Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person.\n",
      "Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping, and then went through a pantomime at his father's door, to prove the statement.\n",
      "`` Very well'', Payne said.\n",
      "He smiled, but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he did not intend to go.\n",
      "Reversing it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head, over and over again.\n",
      "It was the first blow that was always difficult.\n",
      "After that, violence was exultantly easy.\n",
      "Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless, so that he would puzzle over it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real.\n",
      "The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming, `` Murder''.\n",
      "Payne was more methodical than that.\n",
      "He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.\n",
      "It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams.\n",
      "He would not have wanted to hurt a lady.\n",
      "When the knife went into his chest, he went down at once.\n",
      "He clattered down the stairs and out of the door.\n",
      "After some time he came to an open field.\n",
      "An open field was better than a building, that was for sure, so he dismounted, turned off the horse, and plunged through the grass.\n",
      "he knew he should get to Cap, but he didn't know how.\n",
      "So choosing a good tree, he clambered up into it, found a comfortable notch, and curled up in it to sleep, like the tousled bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though surfeited with honey.\n",
      "It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more.\n",
      "On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual.\n",
      "As Sir Giles Overreach( how often had he had to play that part, who did not believe a word of it), he raised his arm and declaimed: `` Where is my honour now''??\n",
      "He was delighted to see them so happy.\n",
      "Everyone is ambivalent about his profession, if he has practised it long enough, but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there, who might cheer you or boo you, but that was largely, though not entirely, up to you.\n",
      "Since she could not act, one part suited her as well as any other, and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water, holding it up to the box, high above her head, to Miss Harris, who had asked for it.\n",
      "She had been one of the first to collect her wits.\n",
      "It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience, as that they had been stunned already.\n",
      "Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before, and unless Miss Keene was on stage, there was not much to it.\n",
      "`` Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you sockdologizing old mantrap''!!\n",
      "Yet even that explosion did not mean much.\n",
      "They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily.\n",
      "The figure was so theatrically dressed, that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one.\n",
      "The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon.\n",
      "This figure looked like the slave dealer from that.\n",
      "There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.\n",
      "There was no mistaking that scream.\n",
      "It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do.\n",
      "On the stage, Harry Hawk began to weep.\n",
      "The crowd began to move.\n",
      "It was not exactly panic they gave way to, but they could not just sit there.\n",
      "At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor.\n",
      "A Dr. Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box.\n",
      "In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob, on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water.\n",
      "He went straight to the Presidential box.\n",
      "Rathbone said he was bleeding to death.\n",
      "By the look of him he wasn't that far gone.\n",
      "Stevie twisted and, frantically, commanded the mare to leap straight ahead.\n",
      "With a bold arm, he dared once more to obstruct them.\n",
      "Seizing the bridle, he tugged with all his might and forced Katie to her knees.\n",
      "Katie scrambled to her feet, Stevie agilely retaining his seat.\n",
      "Again Katie reared, and now, wickedly, he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger.\n",
      "They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand.\n",
      "his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt.\n",
      "He stared at the far morning, expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon.\n",
      "He raced to the window and yanked at the sash.\n",
      "`` They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high.\n",
      "He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square.\n",
      "The spire seemed to hold up the sky.\n",
      "the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street;;\n",
      "There was no church like Drew Church, no preacher like Papa, who was intimate with Him, and could consign sinners to hellfire.\n",
      "The veterans, idling on their benches in the Square, beneath the soldiers' monument, got to their feet when Papa approached: `` Morning, Reverend''!!\n",
      "His being and His will -- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa -- illumined every parish face, turned the choir into a band of angels, and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven.\n",
      "When Papa went out to do God's work, Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy, which was drawn by Violet, the new black mare.\n",
      "Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and northward to Brooklyn, below Point Peter, he could see the church spire wherever he looked back.\n",
      "-- and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras;;\n",
      "that was Pennsylvania.\n",
      "South of Laurel Grove Cemetery, and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware, was the Tri-State Rock, from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as New York, simply by spinning around on his heel.\n",
      "On these excursions, Papa instructed him on man's chief end, which was his duty to God and his own salvation.\n",
      "it troubled him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw.\n",
      "Ludie inquired every evening, pretending that he did not care.\n",
      "`` Somebody's got to be a preacher in the family.\n",
      "At the end of a shaft of light, the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon.\n",
      "`` It's time you began to think on God, Stephen.\n",
      "Open your heart to Him and pray, Stephen, pray!!\n",
      "For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire''.\n",
      "Stevie had heard these words many times, yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble.\n",
      "He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath;;\n",
      "he must pray to be spared.\n"

      "Well, yes, perhaps in literature, since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself.\n",
      "The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age.\n",
      "For it was Rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write, and that he couldn't write.\n",
      "These little songs, however, were sweet nothings from the heart, tender memories of his childhood, little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep.\n",
      "That glory, craved for so long, was now forbidden to him.\n",
      "And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.\n",
      "But then, after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering, everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever, and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.\n",
      "Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite, standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance.\n",
      "Rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance, he would indeed, just for his own private satisfaction, dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices.\n",
      "`` I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think'', he said.\n",
      "Duclos, the historian, pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible.\n",
      "The musicians of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound.\n",
      "Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.\n",
      "But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance of his opera Armide, behind closed doors, just for himself alone.\n",
      "Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau: that the writer of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta.\n",
      "`` Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy'', he suggested.\n",
      "No one will even suspect that it is your work''.\n",
      "To that Rousseau could agree.\n",
      "Afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted, and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself.\n",
      "And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity, Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.\n",
      "All these emotions were screwed up to new heights when, after acceptance and the first rehearsals, there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's amusements, and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau.\n",
      "Jean Jacques asked, striving to appear unimpressed.\n",
      "But I said I would first have to get the author's permission.\n",
      "Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse, and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial??\n",
      "Now, when everything was opening up to him -- even the court of Louis 15!!\n",
      "-- he had to play a role of self-effacement.\n",
      "Back and forth Duclos had to go, between M. De Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke D'Aumont and Jean Jacques again, as his little operetta, The Village Soothsayer, though still unperformed, took on ever more importance.\n",
      "And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends.\n",
      "But they, naturally, kept his secret well, and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles.\n",
      "How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer, but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals.\n",
      "The furor was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational.\n",
      "And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe, Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration, trembling lest his authorship become known, and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer.\n",
      "And that was why, on the day of the performance, when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace, he did not bother to shave.\n",
      "On the contrary, he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days.\n",
      "Seeing him in that condition, and about to enter the hall where the King, the Queen, the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present, Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him.\n",
      "`` You can't go in that way''!!\n",
      "`` Who is going to stop me''??\n",
      "They pointed out to him.\n",
      "`` If they are here, then surely I have the right to be here'', Rousseau said.\n",
      "`` Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face??\n",
      "Now times have changed, and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face.\n",
      "Now, if you don't mind, I should like to hear my own piece performed''.\n",
      "And this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society, his fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark.\n",
      "And even deeper than that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself.\n",
      "He came spurring and whooping down the road, his horse kicking up clouds of dust, shouting:\n",
      "I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man, and when a very small man is up on a saddle, he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there.\n",
      "but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction.\n",
      "The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall, and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation.\n",
      "We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us, and we crouched behind it.\n",
      "I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars, but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant.\n",
      "and I know that I, myself, was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun.\n",
      "I wanted to wipe my flint, but I didn't dare to, the state my hands were in, just as I didn't dare to do anything about the priming.\n",
      "I put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun, because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it.\n",
      "The gunfire, which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now, stopped for long enough to count to twenty;;\n",
      "and in that brief interval, a redcoat officer came tearing down the road, whipping his horse fit to kill.\n",
      "but when he passed us by, a musket roared, and he reared his horse, swung it around, and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come.\n",
      "The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster, and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle, except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup.\n",
      "It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays;;\n",
      "And now the redcoats were coming, and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us.\n",
      "I must state that the faster things happened, the slower they happened;;\n",
      "the passage and rhythm of time changed, and when I remember back to what happened then, each event is a separate and frozen incident.\n",
      "In my recollection, there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats, and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely.\n",
      "Rank after rank of them came down the road, and the faces were all the same, and they walked in a sea of dust.\n",
      "A voice called, and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant, only some of them glancing toward the stone wall, from behind which the voice came.\n",
      "The front of their column had already passed us, when another officer came riding down the side of the road, not five paces from where we were.\n",
      "the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks, and during the next second or two, we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers.\n",
      "but I have no memory of that.\n",
      "I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun, and to my amazement, it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule;;\n",
      "and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound, hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew, sobbing and shouting, and aware that if I had passed water before, it was not enough, for my pants were soaking wet.\n",
      "I would have stood there and died there if left to myself, but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there;;\n",
      "and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far.\n",
      "Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall.\n",
      "Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching.\n",
      "We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole, a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle.\n",
      "A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane, as perhaps we were at that moment, with the crazy excitement of our first encounter, the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road, and the thirst of some of the men, which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it.\n",
      "and though he had found the strength to run with us, now he collapsed and lay on the ground, dying, the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow.\n",
      "It may appear that we were cruel and callous, but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend.\n",
      "I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball, as Isaac had been, yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself.\n",
      "I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road, and the fact that I was not afraid now, but only waiting to know what to do next.\n",
      "We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road, and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it.\n",
      "Wherever you looked, you saw Committeemen running across the meadows, some away from the road, some toward it, some parallel to it;;\n",
      "and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty Militia were making their way in our direction.\n",
      "Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column, but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road.\n",
      "I didn't offer any advice, but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out.\n",
      "Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it, the British would be gone;;\n",
      "but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning, and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass, what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts.\n",
      "While this was being discussed, we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road.\n",
      "It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge, which entitled them to a sort of veteran status, and we felt that if they employed this tactic, it was likely enough the best one.\n",
      "Cousin Joshua Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed away -- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world.\n",
      "I went off with Cousin Simmons, who maintained that if he didn't see to me, he didn't know who would.\n",
      "`` Good heavens, Adam'', he said, `` I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place''.\n",
      "`` I learned that now'', I said.\n",
      "We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road, panting from the effort and soaked with sweat.\n",
      "There was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road, and the shouting and gunfire never slackened.\n",
      "`` God's name, what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on''!!\n",
      "They tried to outface him, but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men, and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him.\n",
      "The slit breeches had to go.\n",
      "In defiance, a chinless reprobate, Jake Camaret, marched down the aisle in St. Peter's one Sunday morning, followed by one of the women from the Bordel, whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame.\n",
      "Plunking themselves down on the front bench, they turned to smirk at those around them.\n",
      "John's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy.\n",
      "But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him.\n",
      "Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well.\n",
      "He finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man.\n",
      "The next morning, as the clock struck nine, he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected.\n",
      "`` Stick to the preaching of the Gospel''!!\n",
      "I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil''!!\n",
      "Monsieur Favre sat down in his high-backed stall, lips compressed, eyes glinting.\n",
      "Every eye was on him as he began to speak.\n",
      "Abel Poupin, a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes, got to his feet.\n",
      "`` We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together.\n",
      "It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers''.\n",
      "`` Do not listen to that Frenchman.\n",
      "He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win''!!\n",
      "Charles had died two weeks before, in early November, without being reconciled to the Church.\n",
      "The canons, in a body, had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church, but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith.\n",
      "Burial had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet, so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned.\n",
      "John closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's bedroom, where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs.\n",
      "she, too, prayed only to God.\n",
      "For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte, the touch of his mother's hand, the lilt of Charles's voice in the square raftered rooms, his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons, and the sight of the beloved bishop.\n",
      "But he had to follow the light.\n",
      "Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy Scriptures, why had He given them to him??\n",
      "The city had recently given him a small salary, but it was not enough to supply even necessities.\n",
      "As he neared the square, a round figure muffled in a long, black cape whisked by.\n",
      "How grateful he was to such men!!\n",
      "There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians.\n",
      "Despite their efforts, the problems seemed to grow graver all the time.\n",
      "Quickening his steps, John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells.\n",
      "He brushed back his black hair, shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes.\n",
      "Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks;;\n",
      "He stood very still, his arms at his sides, staring up at the heavens, then down at the blinking lights below.\n",
      "He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult.\n",
      "But William continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church.\n",
      "And Anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that.\n",
      "Geneva, instead of becoming the City of God, as John had dreamed, had in the two years since he had been there, continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished.\n",
      "Refugees poured in, signing the Confession and rules in order to remain, and then disregarding them.\n",
      "Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded: `` Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope, Master Calvin, to curtail our liberty??\n",
      "Why, oh why, doesn't he stick to preaching the Gospel, instead of meddling in civic affairs, politics, economics, and social issues that are no concern of the Church''??\n",
      "And John's reply was always the same: `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church!!\n",
      "Monsieur Favre's threat would become a reality, for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that Frenchman''.\n",
      "The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie.\n",
      "He started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher, who had been one of the early Gospelers in Paris.\n",
      "Is that you??\n",
      "I came to warn you of a plot''!!\n",
      "Slowly, like a man grown old, he took Eli's hand and led him below to the tower study, guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned.\n",
      "I went to your rooms, and Anthony told me you were here.\n",
      "Two Anabaptists, Caroli and Benoit, are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council.\n",
      "It is to be a trap.\n",
      "`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal''.\n",
      "Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists.\n",
      "Peter Caroli had come to Geneva, saying that he had been a bishop of the Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith.\n",
      "He asked to be appointed a preacher.\n",
      "But Michael Sept had unmasked him, revealing he had never been a bishop, but was an Anabaptist, afraid to state his faith, because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death.\n",
      "So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher, and now Caroli sought revenge.\n",
      "`` There is more to the conspiracy.\n",
      "Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be, with unleavened bread.\n",
      "Furthermore, Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council, preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics''!!\n",
      "We will not yield to the demands of Bern''!!\n",
      "`` Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would co-operate, after you and William are banished, following the debate, I will be given a place of influence''.\n",
      "`` What was your reply to that''??\n",
      "The following morning, as John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee, he had a premonition of danger.\n",
      "He wanted to run, but he knew that if he did, he would be lost.\n",
      "`` Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern''??\n",
      "`` Know this: the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern''.\n",
      "The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down the hill.\n",
      "Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow.\n",
      "With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run, sweat pouring down his face.\n",
      "There was, of course, no real need to rearrange everything.\n",
      "A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake, or the toffee, or the barley sugar, or the sardines, or the bitters, or the condensed milk, or the stationery, or the needles -- what could it mean??\n",
      "Adam watched his own hands make the caressing, anxious movement that, when rain falls and nobody comes, and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles, has been the ritual of stall vendors, forever.\n",
      "He had seen a dry, old, yellowing hand reach out, with that painful solicitude, to touch, to rearrange, to shift aimlessly, some object worth a pfennig.\n",
      "Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture, and at that sight his heart had always died within him.\n",
      "On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand, whatever face it might be.\n",
      "He wondered what expression, as he made that gesture, was on his face.\n",
      "But there was no need, he remembered, for his hand to reach out, for his face to show concern or stoicism.\n",
      "It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came.\n",
      "Or was he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid, befogged loneliness of this land.\n"

      "Before that, he wanted to talk to the neighbors.\n",
      "He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station house too early -- Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference, and he didn't want them subjected to the reporters again.\n",
      "He could think of nothing else to tell them: no assurances, no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day.\n",
      "When the detective left, Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project.\n",
      "Mrs. Andrus was talking to the maid, arranging for her to come in every day, instead of the four days she now worked.\n",
      "In contrast to the caravan of the previous night, there were only four cars parked across the street.\n",
      "He did not see Sparling, or DeGroot, or Ringel, or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago.\n",
      "One of the reporters called to him: `` Anything new, Lieutenant''??\n",
      "And he ignored him, skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house.\n",
      "When McFeeley was halfway to the door, the proprietor emerged -- a mountainous, dark man, his head thick with resiny black hair, his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads.\n",
      "The master of the house, his nourished face unrevealing, consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective.\n",
      "Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps, they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait.\n",
      "then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.\n",
      "They answered him in monosyllables, nods, occasionally muttering in Greek to one another, awaiting the word from Papa, who restlessly cracked his knuckles, anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway.\n",
      "The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy.\n",
      "The equation was simple: wealth brought them happiness, and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had, let no one in on the secrets.\n",
      "they had enough difficulty getting from day to day, let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them.\n",
      "Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case, offered no expression of sympathy, made no move to escort McFeely to the door.\n",
      "He had spoken to Mrs..\n",
      "`` Funny thing'', Mr. Kahler said, when they were seated, `` when I heard you ringing, I figured it was that guy down the block, Hausman''.\n",
      "Kahler continued: `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's sore, so I expected him to come barging in''.\n",
      "Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman's fox terrier had been `` making'' in his flower beds.\n",
      "The dog refused to be scared off, so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers.\n",
      "`` Finally, all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life''.\n",
      "In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room, and then they went across the hall to the kitchen.\n",
      "And put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox.\n",
      "In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver, they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry.\n",
      "While she was settling the teacart, he went back across the hall to their bedroom, opened one of the suitcases, and took out powdered coffee and sugar.\n",
      "`` Do you want to call Eugene''??\n",
      "He didn't, but it was not really a question, and so he left the room, walked down the hall to the front of the apartment, hesitated, and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study.\n",
      "`` Le petit dejeuner'', Harold said, in an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan, his high-school French teacher.\n",
      "At the same time, his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here, and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable, peace-loving, and dependable in everybody.\n",
      "Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible, it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it, and the plate of bread and butter, and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first.\n",
      "Stirring, he said: `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today''.\n",
      "They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained.\n",
      "Eugene was not entirely silent, or openly rude -- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness.\n",
      "It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight, and all it needed, Harold thought, was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it.\n",
      "Eugene offered Harold his car, to use at any time he cared to, and when this offer was not accepted, the armchair creaked.\n",
      "Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown, and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes.\n",
      "`` Excuse me'', he said in Berlitz English, and got up and left them, to bathe and dress.\n",
      "He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was.\n",
      "At that moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out, with his face lathered for shaving, and strode down the hall, tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went.\n",
      "Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord, and when the conversation came to an end, Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment, to his bathroom, where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub.\n",
      "`` She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night''.\n",
      "He handed Harold a key to the front door, and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment.\n",
      "When enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten, Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another.\n",
      "In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle, of mahogany, ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf.\n",
      "Then came their bathroom, and then a bedroom that, judging by the photographs on the walls, must belong to Mme Cestre.\n",
      "It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person.\n",
      "With the metal shutters closed, the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there.\n",
      "One of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas, which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet.\n",
      "Though, taken individually, the big rooms were, or seemed to be, square, the apartment as a whole formed a triangle.\n",
      "The window looked out on the Place Redoute -- it was the only window of the apartment that did.\n",
      "He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything.\n",
      "The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room.\n",
      "The concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer.\n",
      "Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building, and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture -- a big, round, oak dining table and chairs, a buffet, with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame.\n",
      "Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered, they had gone sight-seeing.\n",
      "They went to the Flea Market, expecting to find the treasures of Europe, and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours.\n",
      "it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed, in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute.\n",
      "Instead, they went on down the hall to their room.\n",
      "`` And for that he needs a little bag''??\n",
      "When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment, and thought how, under different circumstances, they might have stayed on here, in these old-fashioned, high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties.\n",
      "He went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom, to turn on the hot-water heater, and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks.\n",
      "But if he has time to go swimming, he had time to be with us''.\n",
      "`` I don't know what I'm going to do with you''.\n",
      "`` I don't think it was that, really''.\n",
      "The thing about Eugene is that he's very proud''.\n",
      "And the thing about hurt feelings, the wet bathing suit pointed out, is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be.\n",
      "Fortunately, the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered, or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields.\n",
      "that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial.\n",
      "His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe.\n",
      "When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap??\n",
      "Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground, while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's asking for Christ's body, Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes, and the others had gone home to mourn.\n",
      "He felt close to Mary, having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey.\n",
      "In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother;;\n",
      "Mary would have to carry the human communication.\n",
      "This seemed right to him.\n",
      "It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems.\n",
      "Since his Christ was to be life size, how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly??\n",
      "There was only one way to accomplish this: by design, by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept.\n",
      "He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper.\n",
      "In particular he sought the gentle, sweet-faced nuns, with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads, remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper.\n",
      "Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes, he began a study of the anatomy of folds.\n",
      "He improvised as he went along, completing a life-size clay figure, then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper, wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber, to the consistency of thick mud.\n",
      "No fold could be accidental, each turn of the drapery had to serve organically, to cover the Madonna's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ's body, to intensify her inner turmoil.\n",
      "When the cloth dried and stiffened, he saw what adjustments had to be made.\n",
      "`` So that's sculpture'', commented Argiento wryly, when he had sluiced down the floor for a week, `` making mud pies''.\n",
      "`` See, Argiento, if you control the way these folds are bunched, like this, or made to flow, you can enrich the body attitudes.\n",
      "He went into the Jewish quarter, wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked.\n",
      "Here, for the most part, they were well treated, as a `` reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity'';;\n",
      "The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work, but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose.\n",
      "He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "`` The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images.\n",
      "That is why our creative people give their time to literature, not to painting or sculpture''.\n",
      "`` But, Rabbi Melzi, you don't object to others creating works of art''??\n",
      "I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew.\n",
      "The rabbi said thoughtfully, `` I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church''.\n",
      "I will send you the best the quarter has to offer''.\n",
      "Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches, asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna.\n",
      "He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe, so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins, led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes.\n",
      "He then draped him over the rough stand, explained that he was supposed to be recently dead, and was being held on his mother's lap.\n",
      "But at the end of the sitting, when Michelangelo showed him the quick, free drawings, with the mother roughed in, holding her son, the model grasped what Michelangelo was after, and promised to speak to his friends.\n",
      "His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman, even as had his memory of his mother.\n",
      "Here he sketched, sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk, young girls not yet twenty, some about to be married, some married a year or two.\n",
      "He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes.\n",
      "He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together: a Mary who would be young and sensitive, yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap;;\n",
      "and a Jesus who, though lean, was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito.\n",
      "He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory, without need to consult his sketches.\n",
      "Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay.\n",
      "Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms.\n",
      "When he wanted to emphasize, or get greater intensity, he added or subtracted clay.\n",
      "Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence.\n",
      "the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh, as in an abdomen, in a reclining torso;;\n",
      "the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull.\n",
      "Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind;;\n",
      "too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model.\n",
      "The true surge had to be inside the marble itself.\n",
      "The arrangement with Argiento was working well, except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice.\n",
      "Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors, whether they were dirty or not;;\n",
      "`` Argiento, this is senseless'', he complained, not liking to work on the wet floors, particularly in cold weather.\n",
      "`` And God help anyone who tries to unteach you''!!\n",
      "yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about, for Argiento made few demands on him.\n",
      "The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome.\n",
      "On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them, and in particular to see their horses.\n",
      "It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him.\n",
      "Argiento made him lie down on the bed, brought a pan of hot water, dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter.\n",
      "By the second day Michelangelo began to worry;;\n",
      "At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli.\n",
      "He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage, cut a large vein under its wing, let the blood gush into Michelangelo's injured eye.\n",
      "They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister.\n",
      "When he told her God had called the child to Him, she rejected his words rebelliously.\n",
      "`` God called her to Him'', the minister had said.\n",
      "God would not do that, Kate thought stubbornly.\n",
      "In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum, and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God.\n",
      "She held Jonathan's letter, his words burning like a brand, and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed.\n",
      "She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son.\n",
      "When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty.\n",
      "She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done.\n",
      "She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery, although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby's death.\n",
      "Juanita drooped about the place, wearing a haunted, brooding look, which Kate attributed to the baby's death, until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita Fitzroy'', bearing a Grafton postmark.\n",
      "Seeing the slanting hand, Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel.\n",
      "The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains.\n",
      "Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended, at what involvement existed for Juanita.\n",
      "He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies, but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs. Lattimer's funeral.\n",
      "`` You're gonna get caught'', she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning.\n",
      "`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless, deaf old man who takes to drink.\n",
      "I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure''.\n",
      "Stranger, Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle, drunkenly singing `` Old Dan Tucker'' at the top of his voice.\n",
      "What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan, threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas.\n",
      "She tried to find some way to draw him out, to help him.\n",
      "Whenever she found time, she went blackberry picking with him, and they would come home together, mouths purple, arms and faces scratched, tired enough to forget grief for another day.\n",
      "No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph.\n",
      "The men were restive, he wrote, ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished.\n",
      "Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South `` And, dear Kate'', she wrote, `` poor Dr. Breckenridge's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South, to his good father's sorrow.\n",
      "In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral, John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory''!!\n",
      "Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news.\n",
      "`` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight'', the old man told them.\n",
      "In the next few days they had cause to rejoice.\n",
      "Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing.\n",
      "Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate.\n",
      "When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out, she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful.\n",
      "They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come, for Virginia had defended her land victoriously.\n",
      "Were they to be insulted again because of the South's great victory??\n",
      "She remembered McClellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs.\n",
      "At the landing she saw Juanita, her face flushed pink with excitement, run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door.\n",
      "Juanita stopped just inside the open door, her hand to her mouth.\n",
      "As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway, his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore.\n",
      "`` I stopped to say goodbye, Mrs. Lattimer, and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby.\n",
      "`` It was a terrible loss to me'', said Kate quietly, feeling the pain twist again at the mention, knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton.\n",
      "`` Where will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg''??\n",
      "He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac.\n",
      "I am to go to Washington to serve with him''.\n",
      "`` When are you to leave''??\n",
      "Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell, Mrs. Lattimer''??\n",
      "`` Stay here in the parlor where it's cool'', she said, trying to be calm.\n",
      "It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them.\n",
      "Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden.\n",
      "When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue, Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry.\n",
      "`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow'', she told Kate.\n",
      "`` What do you want to do''??\n",
      "It's your decision'', said Juanita, holding her face very still, trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly.\n",
      "The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years, and they needed to say no more.\n",
      "They slept -- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring, the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table.\n",
      "In the ballroom below, the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows.\n",
      "Martha Schuyler, old, slow, careful of foot, came down the great staircase, dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk, her jeweled shoe buckles held forward.\n",
      "She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it.\n",
      "Peter, you lummox, you've forgot to order the musicians''.\n",
      "She stood there, a large old woman, smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning, this big foolish baby of a son.\n",
      "Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom.\n",
      "He had ridden hard from Boston, and he was not used to horseback.\n",
      "Now, driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler, he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move.\n",
      "He would cross to Manhattan, to Harlem Heights, before morning.\n",
      "Mynheer, Sir Francis, the valley society, the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks, and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road.\n",
      "The ungainly bird thing ran away, and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster.\n",
      "It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets, mostly around the Battery, going bravely north to Wall Street, but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights.\n",
      "On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound.\n",
      "The morning hawk, hungry for any eatable, killable, digestible item, kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay, sheltered by the Jersey inlets.\n",
      "The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him, the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black, the bronze cannon at the ports.\n",
      "The captain's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune.\n",
      "On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism'' -- the town dwellers -- watched the ships and waited.\n",
      "The chevaux de frise, those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery, pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in.\n",
      "their rock paths led down to the Hudson.\n",
      "Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County, past the white church at Fishkill, past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson, to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen.\n",
      "Waited for more ships, more lobster-backed infantry, and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion??\n",
      "He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept.\n",
      "Now there was more to do.\n",
      "Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government.\n",
      "There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon, but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war.\n",
      "David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface.\n",
      "He knew that many were using it for their own ends.\n",
      "what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born.\n",
      "The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers.\n",
      "No doubt John Hancock would do well now;;\n",
      "And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler's??\n",
      "Things like that would increase rather than be done away with.\n",
      "One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing.\n",
      "He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream.\n",
      "David began to shave with great sweeping strokes.\n",
      "It is harder, he muttered, to meditate on man( or woman) than on God.\n",
      "He was proud that he had never worn a wig.\n",
      "It is so easy to falsify sentiment.\n",
      "he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much.\n",
      "He began to pack the saddlebags.\n",
      "And all this too shall pass away: it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy -- yes, in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley, where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires.\n",
      "He wondered how they could go on in poverty, superstition, ignorance, with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish.\n",
      "A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched.\n",
      "Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference.\n",
      "The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich, but no one seemed to care.\n",
      "In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink.\n",
      "When Alexander Brandel rose to speak, the hall became silent.\n",
      "We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion''.\n",
      "It had sounded good to Andrei, but he did not believe it.\n",
      "In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine.\n",
      "Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex, `` I only want to be a Pole.\n",
      "And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief.\n",
      "I hate Warsaw, he said to himself.\n",

      "Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it, not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel.\n",
      "He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego, demanding to be satisfied, for the two were intertwined and could not be separated.\n",
      "He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated, the Communists in the village rooted out, the mission standing triumphant, for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant, too.\n",
      "But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving, indefatigable force for good in the world.\n",
      "How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice.\n",
      "He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory, however it was brought about, would be sweet indeed.\n",
      "His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days.\n",
      "His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop, using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse.\n",
      "In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked, telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning.\n",
      "He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor -- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy.\n",
      "He was to get involved in no arguments;;\n",
      "he was to try to make no converts;;\n",
      "he was simply to listen and report back what he heard.\n",
      "If he wanted to know anything, he would end up asking about it point-blank, but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection.\n",
      "From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job, any job -- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand -- he had been ready to become a Christian.\n",
      "he knew the fundamentals, and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector, announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that.\n",
      "Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino's past.\n",
      "Without exception Hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations, but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller.\n",
      "often tempted to ask questions but he never did.\n",
      "If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences, he would do so unasked.\n",
      "Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information, ready to impart it with his customary gusto, liberally embellished with his active imagnation.\n",
      "When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village, Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return, for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important.\n",
      "He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line.\n",
      "The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries, the secretary said, businessmen from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission.\n",
      "When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here''??\n",
      "`` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time''.\n",
      "He was about to hang up the phone, but a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation open.\n",
      "He had something more to say.\n",
      "`` I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers'', he said.\n",
      "`` Unless the oyabun has been working on it'', he said, then checked himself and added: `` You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use''.\n",
      "Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission.\n",
      "For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence, and from all the available information it was probably the latter.\n",
      "Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this, a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village.\n",
      "At the same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity.\n",
      "No, Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived.\n",
      "When he had given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors, using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds.\n",
      "Rector asked him to move it for the time being;;\n",
      "he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless.\n",
      "`` I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon'', Rector said, He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create, the picture of a very busy mission.\n",
      "He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly, just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner.\n",
      "Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested.\n",
      "He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside.\n",
      "The little Ito girl had had to go home.\n",
      "`` I would like them to appear very busy today, not busy exactly, but joyous, exuberant, full of life.\n",
      "I want to create the impression of a compound full of children.\n",
      "As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him.\n",
      "The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits, but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident.\n",
      "`` I think I've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time'', he said.\n",
      "`` I've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low.\n",
      "It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it.\n",
      "`` You are about to become a first-class surveyor'', Rector said.\n",
      "`` When Konishi gets back with the jeep, I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys.\n",
      "The glass is out of it, but that won't matter.\n",
      "He went on to explain what he had in mind.\n",
      "Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall.\n",
      "It was rather a childish game, all in all, but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much.\n",
      "He was not sure what effect it would have, but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it.\n",
      "He was not going to lose the mission by default, and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission, he was going to be in for a surprise.\n",
      "He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall, and then to take charge of the office while the party was here.\n",
      "When everything had been done, Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock.\n",
      "At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi's party.\n",
      "She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient.\n",
      "He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger, but -- joy of joys, he would be at home at the hour mentioned.\n",
      "But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement.\n",
      "She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed.\n",
      "Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose.\n",
      "At last he consented to meet her, and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal:\n",
      "Have you any objection to the following plan??\n",
      "She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where'' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners'' and `` the wild originality of your countenance''.\n",
      "And he would see her that evening.\n",
      "At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where'' -- he would attend to that.\n",
      "There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and, as Claire rose to go, he asked her to sing him one song before she left.\n",
      "`` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale.\n",
      "There have been cooing doves, chattering magpies, thieving jackdaws, a proud peacock, a silly goose, and a harpy eagle -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals''.\n",
      "Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey, the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.\n",
      "Alas, all that belonged to the age of `` Devil Dashwood'' and `` Wicked Wilkes'', abbot and beadsman of the Order!!\n",
      "They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate.\n",
      "A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace, the air about them scented with stock, and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden.\n",
      "Charming and peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure??\n",
      "How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers.\n",
      "How was she to behave, Claire wondered.\n",
      "To be passive, to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd.\n",
      "And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience, satiety might well be an equal handicap.\n",
      "Mystery -- that was the thing.\n",
      "With his club foot he might well be grateful.\n",
      "At the inn, which was situated close to a broad weir, Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as `` milord''.\n",
      "The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown.\n",
      "`` Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell''.\n",
      "`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney, milord, but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again''.\n",
      "So, not only had he been here before, but it seemed he might well come again.\n",
      "When Napoleon's ship had borne him to Elba, French wines had started to cross the Channel, the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years, but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled.\n",
      "`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important'', she rebutted.\n",
      "`` Tell me about Minerva, how she behaved, what she did to please you''.\n",
      "I don't ask you who'tis you're being unfaithful to, husband or lover.\n",
      "For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity, who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind.\n",
      "`` Very well'', she said, `` I'll not catechize you.\n",
      "The light supper over, Claire went to him and, slipping an arm about his shoulder, sat on his knee.\n",
      "He drew her close and, hand on cheek, turned her face to his.\n",
      "His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown;;\n",
      "then, to better purpose, he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers, untied it.\n",
      "The bodice beneath was buttoned and, withdrawing his lips from hers, he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it, unhurriedly as if she were a child.\n",
      "She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom.\n",
      "Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color.\n",
      "He rose and went to the bedroom.\n",
      "When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron's mistress.\n",
      "By odd coincidence, on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina, which was the latest of the titled poet's successes.\n",
      "As he declaimed the sonorous measures, it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings.\n",
      "`` How do you know that''??\n",
      "`` I mustn't tell, I mustn't tell'', she repeated to herself.\n",
      "With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter:\n",
      "`` Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement, and that her child is well''.\n",
      "At the same time another child -- this one of Shelley's brain -- was given to the world: Alastor, a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind's musings.\n",
      "Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked, contemptuously ignored.\n",
      "Shelley sent a copy to Southey, a former friend, and another to Godwin.\n",
      "`` You have made the labor worth while'', he said to her, smiling.\n",
      "There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor.\n",
      "What about that dear, clever Mr. Thynne??\n",
      "`` Poor Mr. Thynne, he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement''.\n",
      "Mary's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute.\n",
      "The same month that Alastor was published, Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege Of Corinth, a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley's generosity rebelled at.\n",
      "The previous scandals, gaily diverting as they were, had only served to increase his popularity.\n",
      "Now, under the impact of his wife's disclosures, he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance, however brilliant, however far-famed the offender might be.\n",
      "He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister, but he soon saw, as did she, that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin.\n",
      "For the moment there was no woman in his life, and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity.\n",
      "He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor, claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes.\n",
      "Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel.\n",
      "He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order, but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel's belt.\n",

      "If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes, say, then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud.\n",
      "Say three minutes to make it sporting.\n",
      "The man began to creep in the wrong direction, deceived by a slight rise in the ground!!\n",
      "He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart.\n",
      "The guards came to life with astonishing menace.\n",
      "One man dropped to his knee for better aim.\n",
      "Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped, panting heavily.\n",
      "He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm.\n",
      "Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet.\n",
      "-- Henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there.\n",
      "Watson stumbled down the bank.\n",
      "He promised to take me.\n",
      "Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff.\n",
      "The man swayed on a thwart, turning his ruined eyes from side to side.\n",
      "-- Make him lie down!!\n",
      "He had not meant to shout.\n",
      "He stood with his back to the skiff.\n",
      "The men mewed and scratched, begging to be taken away.\n",
      "Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches.\n",
      "What do you do to them??\n",
      "He had not felt that during the afternoon.\n",
      "In war, on a night like this, it was only the outward emotions that mattered, what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others.\n",
      "John's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen.\n",
      "What a fool he had been to think of his brother!!\n",
      "What had he thought of, to go to John, grovel and beg understanding??\n",
      "Men were slaughtered every day, tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute.\n",
      "What made him think John had a right to witness his brother's humiliation??\n",
      "What right had John to any special consideration??\n",
      "Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles, rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman's beautiful, schoolmaster's hand.\n",
      "He believed that brave boys didn't cry.\n",
      "He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain.\n",
      "Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering.\n",
      "I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming, `` O Gogol, O Chekhov, O Thackeray and Dickens, what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks, a birdbath, and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps''??\n",
      "As I say, I wouldn't want to begin a day like this, but I often wonder what the dead would have done.\n",
      "But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge.\n",
      "It was built by the Pasterns, and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property.\n",
      "It bulks under a veil of thin, new grass, like some embarrassing fact of physicalness, and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning.\n",
      "Offer her a cup of tea and she would say, `` Why, these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year''.\n",
      "These trumps were more touching than they were anything else, and seemed to imply that the nights were long, her children ungrateful, and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare.\n",
      "She usually wore weeds, and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead, but Mr. Pastern was far from dead.\n",
      "He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting, `` Bomb Cuba!!\n",
      "One might pretend never to have seen one before, or, to more purpose, that there would never be another like it.\n",
      "Leaving her house one late afternoon, Mrs. Pastern stopped to admire the October light.\n",
      "It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis.\n",
      "It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks.\n",
      "Mrs. Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league, Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis, and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton's house, a roof that signified gout.\n",
      "Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer.\n",
      "Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry.\n",
      "The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year, and while the money, of course, was not hers, it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks.\n",
      "She stayed too late, and when she left, it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband.\n",
      "I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner''??\n",
      "He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins', thinking that they might give him a drink.\n",
      "Turning in at the Flannagans' driveway, he tried to remember if he had ever met them.\n",
      "The name encouraged him, because he always felt that he could handle the Irish.\n",
      "Her hair was dyed, and her bloom was fading, and she must have been crowding forty, but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight.\n",
      "`` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money, that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook.\n",
      "A fire had just been lighted, he saw, and things had been set out for drinks, and, like any stray, his response to these comforts was instantaneous.\n",
      "At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers, and she began to riffle these, making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation.\n",
      "`` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting'', she said, `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait??\n",
      "`` If you will promise to make it weak''.\n",
      "`` Sit down'', he said, `` and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later.\n",
      "The only way to find things is to relax''.\n",
      "She didn't like to travel.\n",
      "Planes made her feel faint, and in Tokyo, where she had gone that summer, she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home.\n",
      "And knowing its humble place in the scale of things, why did he, at this time of life, seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness??\n",
      "The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them, but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there.\n",
      "`` I've never done this before'', she said later, when he was arranging himself to leave.\n",
      "`` I've never done this before'', they always said, shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders.\n",
      "Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news.\n",
      "It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known.\n",
      "His worries harried him up out of bed, and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window.\n",
      "During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track, and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying, like leaves, in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga.\n",
      "Maple and ash, beech and elm, one hundred to win on Three in the fourth, fifty to win on Six in the third, one hundred to win on Two in the eighth.\n",
      "Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage.\n",
      "There are, he thought, so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed, as it did, a little crude??\n",
      "It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years, not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil;;\n",
      "that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives( two marriages, two births, one divorce), Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years.\n",
      "She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire, warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray.\n",
      "There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters, one to Abel, one to Mark.\n",
      "`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can'', the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen, `` I have an important matter to discuss with you''.\n",
      "To Abel: `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here.\n",
      "You may stay as long as you wish, of course, but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account, I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in''.\n",
      "To Mark: `` Please give my regards to Myra''.\n",
      "She signed the letters quickly, stamped them, and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town.\n",
      "Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water.\n",
      "`` My nephews will be coming down'', she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room, the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray.\n",
      "from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way, they had faded to a near-absence of color which had, possibly from her constant looking at the water, something of the light of the sea in them.\n",
      "`` Um'', said the old lady, and brought her eyes down to the tray.\n",
      "`` Yes'', she said, `` I remember that they came here every summer.\n",
      "I used to play with the older one sometimes, when he'd let me.\n",
      "For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway;;\n",
      "What had once been a widespread family -- at one time, she knew, there were enough Packards to populate an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys, Abel and Mark.\n",
      "She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window, her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans.\n",
      "What hope lay in the nephews, she asked the intensifying light out there, with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced, having sired two girl children, with none to bear on the Packard name??\n",
      "It seemed to her, as it seemed each night, that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs, giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows.\n",
      "Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed, consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years.\n",
      "She thought again of her children, those two who had died young, before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies.\n",
      "In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged, quick with the delight of laughter, and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her.\n",
      "The brothers drove down together in Mark's small red sports car, Mark at the wheel.\n",
      "Abel sat and regarded the farm country which, spreading out from both sides of the road, rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields.\n",
      "And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger, impervious, complete in itself.\n",
      "`` I suppose it has to do with the property'', Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters.\n",
      "He and Mark were the last of the family, and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end, stretching from horizon to horizon, in those golden days of summer.\n",
      "Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother.\n",
      "Mark held the wheel loosely, but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come.\n",
      "His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides, and Abel looked quickly away.\n",
      "He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel, hugging it to him, and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt.\n",
      "It was barely possible that his brother was right.\n",
      "The air took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind.\n",
      "He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which, built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor, had been Izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended.\n",
      "'' Mark asked, and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road, the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down.\n",
      "There was the day Uncle Izaak had, in an unexpected grandiose gesture, handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps, on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished.\n",
      "They seemed then to have had a single mind and body, a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth, casually.\n",
      "Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting, ready, for the two of them to run up her sails.\n",
      "His eyes were old and they never saw well, but heated with whisky they'd glare at my noise, growing red and raising up his rage.\n",
      "I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too, dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch, dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall, Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow, snoring and whistling.\n",
      "He'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain.\n",
      "I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him.\n",
      "The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head, fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed, but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought, Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now.\n",
      "He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him.\n",
      "I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough.\n",
      "When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck, watering my eyes, and I backed off to cough.\n",
      "Pa was on his side, looking at me, his eyes winking, the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow.\n",
      "I didn't say anything, trying to get my throat clear, but I watched him.\n",
      "He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear.\n",
      "He told me to wake you''.\n",
      "`` Nothing to steal from the crib''.\n",
      "`` I goddamn well understand''.\n",
      "`` I goddamn well understand.\n",
      "You know I don't want to see Pedersen.\n",
      "You want me to drop my pot''??\n",
      "He was about to get up so I got out, slamming the door.\n",
      "He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep.\n",
      "Pa'd been shit-sick in that pot.\n",
      "He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped.\n",
      "He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house.\n",
      "I always felt the memory was present in both of them, stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl, as eager as an animal to be out.\n",
      "Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was, and the dough was turning pasty, sticking to the kid's back and behind.\n",
      "`` Ain't he going to wake up''??\n",
      "What's he going to do''??\n",
      "`` Go back to sleep most likely''.\n",
      "`` You'd best get that whisky''.\n",
      "Pa's scared to hell of axes''.\n",
      "`` Listen to me, Jorge, I've had enough to your sassing.\n",
      "If I don't get some whisky down him he might die.\n",
      "You want the kid to die??\n",
      "Well, get your pa and get that whisky''.\n",
      "He don't care at all, and I don't care to get my head busted neither.\n",
      "He don't care, and I don't care to have his shit flung on me.\n",
      "All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face.\n",
      "I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me, and he ran down.\n",
      "It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides.\n",
      "Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her.\n",
      "If we had, then one of us would have had to go instead.\n",
      "I thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had.\n",
      "He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big, something heroic even, especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all, not anything like that.\n",
      "They were always trying so you got to expect it.\n",
      "Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable;;\n",
      "but since she didn't know we'd given it to her, there was no easy way of getting it back.\n",
      "She'd found one and she hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter, every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one.\n",
      "Pa was sure to find out.\n",
      "Sometimes he didn't seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't hid one after all or had drunk it up.\n",
      "`` You going to put more towels on him''??\n",
      "That's what he needs, something warm to his skin, don't he''??\n",
      "He's got to thaw slow.\n",
      "You ought to know that''.\n",
      "`` What are we going to do with these''??\n",
      "Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin.\n",
      "I didn't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to.\n",
      "`` Don't hold him like that.\n",
      "He was in his mid-fifties at this time, long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again, and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing.\n",
      "He could no longer build anything, whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil, without it being obvious that he had done it, and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique, they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time, a quality of authentic uniqueness about them, which, once established by an artist as his private vision, is no longer disputable as to its other values.\n",
      "he rose at half-past six every morning, made himself some French coffee, had his corn flakes and more coffee, smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette, then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop.\n",
      "a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill, vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air, masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house, visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor.\n",
      "Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form: his models, drawings, ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days, and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac.\n",
      "Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner, and over his desk, next to several old and dusty hats, was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house.\n",
      "Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him, sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved.\n",
      "This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things, and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine.\n",
      "he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it, and he could not imagine why he should alter it.\n",
      "There are, after all, fortunate souls who hear everything, but only know how to listen to what is good for them, and Stowey was, as things go, a fortunate man.\n",
      "He would wear this same costume in Florida, despite his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him.\n",
      "But he was too busy to hear what she was saying.\n",
      "When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon, feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before, she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head, which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad, and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window.\n",
      "Finding the key under his shoe, he started the engine, and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog, and said, `` Defrost the refrigerator''.\n",
      "He would settle himself into his seat to laugh.\n",
      "And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog, mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to, mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by.\n",
      "She was forty-nine at this time, a lanky woman of breeding with an austere, narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer.\n",
      "Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders.\n",
      "There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes, the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which, besides, has kept its estate intact.\n",
      "But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed, brushed, and taking breaths of air, and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy, a grace of history, so to speak, and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value.\n",
      "She called, trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure.\n",
      "But he did not notice, and was already backing the car down to the road, saying `` Toot-toot''!!\n",
      "To the stump of a tree as he passed it, the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed.\n",
      "Then, when he had it pointed down the hill, he stopped to gaze at her through the window.\n",
      "She had begun to turn back toward the house, but his look caught her and she stood still, waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell.\n",
      "Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot''!!\n",
      "She walked back to the house and entered, feeling herself returning, sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building.\n",
      "She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night, but it always seemed to her that being alone, especially alone in her house, was the realest part of life.\n",
      "Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors;;\n",
      "and finally, the best part of all, simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers, reading the ads as well as the news, registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire.\n",
      "She did this now, comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows, of the silence outside, of the dark afternoon it was getting to be.\n",
      "She fell asleep leaning on her hand, hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years, hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm.\n",
      "Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: Stowey, yes, was on his way south, and the two boys were away in school, and nothing was burning on the stove, and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers.\n",
      "She stood up, smoothing her hair down, straightening her clothes, feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside, and, above everything else, for the absence of the need to answer, to respond, to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out, and yet, now that she was beginning to cook, she glimpsed a future without him, a future alone like this, and the pain made her head writhe, and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests.\n",
      "She went into the living room and turned on three lamps, then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn, illuminating the driveway.\n",
      "She stood still over the leg of lamb, rubbing herbs into it, quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath, a sensation of violence that started her shivering.\n",
      "And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do.\n",
      "for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced, and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife.\n",
      "When they first married he had been working in the fields all day, and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working, to take him a fresh hot meal.\n",
      "Not that she complained, or had any cause to.\n",
      "There was no reason for her to ask what they did.\n",
      "Thus a new pattern of days began to develop, for Granny Albright did not die.\n",
      "They stopped expecting her to die the next minute, but only in the next day or two.\n",
      "but they might as well unpack their suitcases, for she might linger on.\n",
      "When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs, she would go to the Big House.\n",
      "There was not anything she could do there, but that was where everyone was, or would be.\n",
      "The older men would be there at noon, and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town.\n",
      "The children had to play away from the house( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn), to maintain a proper quietness.\n",
      "Off and on, all day, someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything.\n",

      "so that the rest of the house stayed open, though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way.\n",
      "The dust clogged their throats, and the heat parched them, so that the women were always making ice water.\n",
      "They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town, as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there.\n",
      "It was a Cadillac, black grayed with the dust of the road, its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled.\n",
      "They were an old fat couple( as Linda Kay described them to herself), a thick middle-aged man, and a girl about ten or twelve.\n",
      "`` We were on our vacation in Canada'', Howard explained, in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming, `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home.\n",
      "There was the suggestion of ice water, and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really thirsty'' -- Linda Kay, to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices, hurried to the kitchen.\n",
      "Carrying it to the living room, she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim, a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath, with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band.\n",
      "She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it, seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed.\n",
      "We didn't expect him to come along;;\n",
      "This joke was not funny to Linda Kay, and she blushed, as she always did;;\n",
      "She asked Bobby Joe that night.\n",
      "`` Say, did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J''??\n",
      "`` Listen, I never had a chance to kill an antelope.\n",

      "There was really no reason to refuse, and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac.\n",
      "Driving along the caliche-topped road to town, Howard talked.\n",
      "Finally he said, `` Tell me about yourself'', and Linda Kay told him, because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life.\n",
      "It was easy to see that they were made for each other, and they knew what they wanted.\n",
      "Bobby Joe would be a senior this year, and he planned to graduate.\n",
      "But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on, since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and( blushing) raise his children.\n",
      "She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been, but he brought one of the cousins home for supper, and all they did was talk about antelope.\n",
      "Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home.\n",
      "I want to roast the whole thing, and have it for the boys''.\n",
      "Linda Kay told him he couldn't do anything like that with his Grandma dying, and he said well they had to eat, didn't they, they weren't all dying.\n",
      "Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry;;\n",
      "but they were going up to the Big House after supper, and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little.\n",
      "Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's, and sat on the open front porch, where they could get the breeze.\n",
      "That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night.\n",
      "After they had left, some of the people moved around, to find more comfortable places to sit.\n",
      "There were not many chairs, so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch, resting their feet on the ground, and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall.\n",
      "Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable.\n",
      "Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her, touching her actually, and holding her hand from time to time, but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer.\n",
      "Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh, so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers;;\n",
      "He had become the center of the company, such stories he had to tell.\n",
      "He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person;;\n",
      "he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights.\n",
      "`` But tell me, doctor, where do you plan to conduct the hatching''??\n",
      "`` That will have to be in the hotel'', the doctor retorted, confirming Alex's anticipations.\n",
      "`` What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel''.\n",
      "The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel, room number nine, to initiate Alex further into these undertakings.\n",
      "Inside, carefully packed in straw, were six eggs, but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside;;\n",
      "to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs.\n",
      "There was little enough time to contemplate them, however;;\n",
      "The ledger was full of most precise information: date of laying, length of incubation period, number of chick reaching the first week, second week, fifth week, weight of hen, size of rooster's wattles and so on, all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English, the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen.\n",
      "Alex's instruction was rapid, for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole De Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all.\n",
      "But after the doctor's return that night Alex could see, from the high window in his own room, the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels, apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen.\n",
      "It was the doctor, dressed and ready for the expedition to the market, and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste.\n",
      "The doctor stood about, waiting for Alex to dress, with a show of impatience, and soon they were moving, as quietly as could be, through the still-dark hallways, past the bedroom of the patronne, and so into the street.\n",
      "The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery.\n",
      "The doctor, with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope, drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles, the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles, the firm, wide spread of the toes, and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets.\n",
      "and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast.\n",
      "The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat, hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens.\n",
      "They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up, with gingerly steps, towards the first landing.\n",
      "It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and, in some perturbation glancing up, saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing.\n",
      "Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him, attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex's arm and back.\n",
      "Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts, trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him.\n",
      "Eyes swerved in the patronne's head, Alex coughed loudly, and the doctor, with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him, took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps.\n",
      "With that he hurried up the stairs, followed by her suspicious gaze.\n",
      "There was no reference to the incident on the stairs, his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business.\n",
      "The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them.\n",
      "One part of her audience was totally engaged, the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic, the other part, the guest of the connoisseur, attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand.\n",
      "Startled, he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view, and Alex went to the door.\n",
      "He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling, coughing, and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest.\n",
      "It was Giselle, the fille de chambre, come to clean the room, and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity, explaining her errand, Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird.\n",
      "Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again.\n",
      "`` Who was that, young feller''??\n",
      "Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room''.\n",
      "he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice.\n",
      "they climbed the stairs which creaked, very loudly to their sensitive ears, and reached the next floor.\n",
      "they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed.\n",
      "The doctor sat down rather wearily, caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man, but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more.\n",
      "At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes.\n",
      "It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected, and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's.\n",
      "the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door.\n",
      "The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob, but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied.\n",
      "Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat;;\n",
      "The events of the last quarter of an hour, mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard, had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails, perhaps mourning her nest, but briefly enjoyed.\n",
      "Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room.\n",
      "Next, the hen was nested and all seemed well.\n",
      "The two men sat for some time, savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings, before they got up and left the hotel, the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office.\n",
      "Alex returned to the hotel, rather weary and with no new prospects of a role, in the late afternoon, but found the doctor in an ebullient mood.\n",
      "`` Chickens have short memories'', the doctor remarked, `` that's why they are better company than most people I know'', and he went on to break some important news to Alex.\n",
      "`` Well'', he began, `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do.\n",
      "Seems like she's willing, but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do, and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble.\n",
      "Going downstairs with the tray, Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada, but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look.\n",
      "There were times it wasn't right to make a person happy, like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don't keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich.\n",
      "But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure.\n",
      "Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool.\n",
      "`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings'' --\n",
      "`` I guess I better get ready to go''.\n",
      "Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron.\n",
      "`` I don't want to leave here, Winston''.\n",
      "`` Now listen to that''.\n",
      "`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house.\n",
      "`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child''??\n",
      "What you think I care about that??\n",
      "`` We've got plenty of time to think about that.\n",
      "-- and flounced to the sink, where she began noisily to wash her hands.\n",
      "Although it had seemed a good reason, to begin with: no couple could afford to have children.\n",
      "`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you''??\n",
      "`` You want to keep this job, don't you''??\n",
      "He sat for a while with his hands on his knees, watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb, a bottle of aspirin -- to take upstairs and pack.\n",
      "it was something to do with her back, the thinness of it, and the quick, jerky way she bent.\n",
      "She was too young, that was all;;\n",
      "Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work.\n",
      "Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes.\n",
      "Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack, who was pulling on his pigskin gloves.\n",
      "When he was going to town, nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace.\n",
      "`` Good-by, Winston'', Mr. Jack said, giving a final set to his hat.\n",
      "Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car;;\n",
      "a handsome, fine-looking man it made him proud to see.\n",
      "Then he looked at his finger, at the wrinkled, heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up, slit, and open.\n",
      "Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward, and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier.\n",
      "He knew the house like a blind man, through his fingers, and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up.\n",
      "Ten years ago, he had come to the house to be interviewed.\n",
      "She had talked to him right there, with the hot sun in his face, which made him sweat and feel ashamed.\n",
      "Winston had been surprised at her for that.\n",
      "and after that the Japanese cherries.\n",
      "Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes.\n",
      "Sighing, he hurried to the living room.\n",
      "He had a thousand things to see to.\n",
      "He brought it in and put it down beside her.\n",
      "sometimes when he was pressing, Winston raised her dresses to his face.\n",
      "When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph, twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame, Miss Ada said, `` By rights I ought to leave that, seeing he won't take my clotheshorse''.\n",
      "He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it.\n",
      "`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea''??\n",
      "Leave that fool picture out'', she added sharply.\n",
      "`` Mr. Jack sets store by that''.\n",
      "It was meant to be my present''.\n",
      "But she went on down the list.\n",
      "He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet, but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack.\n",
      "`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas''.\n",
      "Finally she had come down;;\n",
      "`` Is that a compliment''??\n",
      "Miss Ada had giggled, and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down.\n",
      "`` You look like that picture I have at the office'', Mr. Jack had started.\n",
      "`` Darling, I love that photograph.\n",
      "I'm going to put it on my dresser''.\n",
      "Make the man put them in if he has to''.\n",
      "After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word.\n",
      "I had no doubt that it was.\n",
      "During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight.\n",
      "Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp, the packing away of my camp uniforms, the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world.\n",
      "But that year was different, for just as the city, in the form of my street clothes, had intruded upon my mountain nights, so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall: Jessica and I, about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs, had agreed to correspond.\n",
      "I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer.\n",
      "My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink, scented stationery and the unsloped, almost printed configurations of her neat, studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer, so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when;;\n",
      "'' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood,, and news of her commencing again her piano lessons, her private school, a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough, wounded, from the war in Europe.\n",
      "In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life.\n",
      "The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands -- he of the porch steps anecdotes -- who smoked cigarettes, performed the tango, wore fifty dollar suits, and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them.\n",
      "Like Eliot, in my fantasies, I had a proud bearing and, with a skill that was vaguely continental, I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits, would guide her gently to the night's climax which, in my dreams, was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep, moist kisses burning with love.\n",
      "The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front, nearly dying, my head bandaged and blooded, and Jessica bending over me, the power of her love bringing me back to life.\n",
      "For many nights afterward, the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires, would cause me to lie awake in shame, tossing with irresolution, longing to fall into a deep sleep.\n",
      "They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless, as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again.\n",
      "Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party, she asked that I come and be her date.\n",
      "Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates, I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect, to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom, later, in the privacy of our bunks, we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance.\n",
      "I remember standing in a corner, watching Jessica act the hostess, serving soft drinks to her guests.\n",
      "She was wearing her dark hair in two, thick braids to attain an `` American Girl'' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween.\n",
      "It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish, I was excited to be with her, but I did not know how to express it.\n",
      "Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages, out of my mind, and plant himself in reality.\n",
      "It was late, we were playing kissing games, and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others.\n",
      "We blushed and were flustered, and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek.\n",
      "The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote, exciting premonitions of lust, all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me.\n",
      "It was at that party that, finally overcoming my timidity, inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys, I asked Jessie to spend New Year's Eve with me.\n",
      "Lovingly, she accepted, and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was, `` You're amazing, you know''??\n",
      "Later, we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night.\n",
      "We would write to one another and make a definite plan.\n",
      "Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her??\n",
      "Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city??\n",
      "Should I accompany her to the door of her home, or should I ask to be invited in??\n",
      "All this was unknown to me, and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year!!\n",
      "When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve, I knew for a moment an immense relief;;\n",
      "In December I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor, a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated.\n",
      "We would attend a film and, later on, I stated, we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child's or Toffenetti's for waffles.\n",
      "At five o'clock that night it was already dark, and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom.\n",
      "I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind, felt older than my years, and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable, tantalizing excitement of Manhattan.\n",
      "Times Square, when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members), was nearly impassable, the sidewalks swarming with celebrants, with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey.\n",
      "Heavy-coated, severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic.\n",
      "The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted, and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner.\n",
      "An old gentlemen next to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out, `` V for Victory''!!\n",
      "Where were they all walking to??\n",
      "Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica??\n",
      "It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking.\n",
      "I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging, curdling crowd and, as the time passed and I waited, a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear: How was I planning to greet Jessica??\n",
      "But when I saw that it was already ten past seven, I began to wonder if something had gone wrong.\n",
      "Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave??\n",
      "Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans??\n",
      "Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps, arriving and departing, while I stayed glued, like a signpost, to one spot.\n",
      "At 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps, carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway, and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground, their golden, fringed epaulets and spic, red-visored caps, I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd.\n",
      "It seemed incredible, as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients, that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois, going to a hospital for the mentally ill.\n",
      "I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan, the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger, her quiet competence, the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses.\n",
      "I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field& Co..\n",
      "She knew that I lived at a good address on the Gold Coast, that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies.\n",
      "She knew also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative.\n",
      "She wasn't quite sure that I felt enough remorse about my drinking, or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again.\n",
      "`` You must have loved that girl very much, but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her''.\n",
      "`` Why do you say that''??\n",
      "`` I was full of booze and, well, a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do''.\n",
      "You're not the kind to go violent.\n",
      "Were you in love with that girl''??\n",
      "`` Would it make any difference to you if I were, Mary Jane''??\n",
      "When I think of people like you, well, I'' --\n",
      "`` You are young, intelligent, have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself, but you mess it up with whiskey, indifference, self-destructive attitudes.\n",
      "I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you.\n",
      "You don't believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish, do you''??\n",
      "They all mean well, have great promises to make when they are about to go home, but drinking is their sickness.\n",
      "It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover.\n",
      "I wanted to go to college, too'' --\n",
      "`` You don't seem to know much about reality.\n",
      "I'll tell you why I didn't go to college;;\n",
      "I'm going to become a good nurse, and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them''.\n",
      "I have no one but myself to worry about''.\n",
      "Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly, and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face.\n",
      "I'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean, after I'm out of the hospital, a month or so from now''.\n",
      "`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years.\n",
      "I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future''.\n",
      "How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover''??\n",
      "`` If I thought you were serious about going back to school, that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well, I might consider such an offer.\n",
      "What about your that girl you were going to kill''??\n",
      "It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused, sick, irresponsible person she believed me to be.\n",
      "`` There are things about me that I can't tell you now, Mary Jane'', I said, `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover, I'd like to tell you the whole story.\n",
      "I can say this: I'm dead serious about going back to school.\n",
      "As for that other girl, let's just say that I never want to see her again.\n",
      "You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover, won't you''??\n",
      "`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner'', I said.\n",
      "`` Do you like to dance??\n",
      "`` I like to dance'', she said, then turned and walked away.\n",
      "I knew that.\n",
      "It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there.\n",
      "Now, riding this hospital bus, feeling isolated and utterly alone, I knew that she was genuine and unique, quite unlike any girl I had known before.\n",
      "It seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me.\n",
      "Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name, or why.\n",
      "It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan would believe it without proof.\n",
      "But I had the proof, all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so.\n",
      "As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes, thinking over the events of the past two weeks, trying to put the pieces in order.\n",
      "I wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me, if I had not perhaps imagined it all.\n",
      "I had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony.\n",
      "It was a bad play, real grade-A turkey, which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal.\n",
      "No one, not even the producer, had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway.\n",
      "But because it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era, many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago, continue as a road company, and eventually become a movie.\n",
      "We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York.\n",
      "It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another.\n",
      "I had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U., had wanted desperately to go to medical school, but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time.\n",
      "Then later I had quit my safe, secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play.\n",
      "It seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well.\n",
      "I knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open.\n",
      "It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting, that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life.\n",
      "I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up, then went to the bathroom for a drink of water.\n",
      "When I answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said, `` Is this Mr. Dale Nelson, the actor''??\n",
      "I started to say something else appropriate, but the man had hung up.\n",
      "I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask Tony.\n",
      "`` All right, you bastards'', I said, `` the great actor is about to buy a drink''.\n",
      "I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round.\n",
      "He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me.\n",
      "I walked over to him.\n",
      "I followed him out through the lobby to the street.\n",
      "`` Okay'', I said to the attendant, `` I'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building''.\n",
      "I walked with him back to the entrance.\n",
      "`` Forgot to get something out of the car'', I told him, showing him my ticket.\n",
      "He started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said, `` Oh, yes.\n",
      "You're the one I was talking to about a monthly rental.\n",
      "I went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug, one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing.\n",
      "I put in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully.\n",
      "I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer, then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114, attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out.\n",
      "One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street, trying to make himself inconspicuous, keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting.\n",
      "For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays, then in people passing by.\n",
      "After a while, however, a person's mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment.\n",
      "You want to sit down.\n",
      "You're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt, that the city pavements are hard.\n"

      "Want me to drive it out''??\n",
      "`` You're going to be a regular.\n",
      "You don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks.\n",
      "I hurried over to the agency heap, jumped in, started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left.\n",
      "I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn.\n",
      "I stayed half a block behind him, letting lots of cars keep in between us, listening to the steady beep beep beep.\n",
      "After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left.\n",
      "I couldn't see him, but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead, short half beeps when the car I was following was to the left, and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right.\n",
      "If it ever got behind me, the beep turned to a buzz.\n",
      "I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right.\n",
      "I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic.\n",
      "My lights would have been a giveaway if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner.\n",
      "His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz.\n",
      "My man came out an hour later, drove to the beach, turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan Motel.\n",
      "I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register.\n",
      "I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar L. Palmer and wife, giving a San Francisco address.\n",
      "She was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering the tenants.\n",
      "`` Your wife isn't going to join you -- later''??\n",
      "`` If you expect her to show up'', she said, `` you'd better put' and wife' on there.\n",
      "`` Not to you'', she said smiling.\n",
      "There are three soft-drink vending machines, and if you should be joined by -- anybody -- try to keep things quiet, if you will.\n",
      "We like to run a nice quiet place''.\n",
      "I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card, then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car.\n",
      "not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment.\n",
      "I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case.\n",
      "With the aid of that I could hear my man moving around, heard him cough a couple of times, heard the toilet flush, heard the sound of water running.\n",
      "Whoever his companion was going to be, she was going to join him later.\n",
      "She knew where to come.\n",
      "He didn't have to telephone.\n",
      "It's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing a meal, but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's bedded down for the night, hunger can be a gnawing torture.\n",
      "I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile.\n",
      "The batteries on the bugging device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals.\n",
      "The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation, and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry.\n",
      "I got in the car, drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included, a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible.\n",
      "The place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night, and the girl who was waiting on me, who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable.\n",
      "`` It's early in the evening to be in a hurry.\n",
      "What's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car''??\n",
      "I said `` Darn it, that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on.\n",
      "She went in to get the hamburgers, and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers.\n",
      "She wanted to hang around while I was eating.\n",
      "`` Don't you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up''??\n",
      "`` It's a kindness to her.\n",
      "She'll eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and I'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place''.\n",
      "I turned on the device again, half fearful that I might find silence, but the buzzes came in loud and clear.\n",
      "When I switched on the lights for her to come and get the check, I had the exact change plus a dollar tip.\n",
      "Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door.\n",
      "At the door, Dave paused to feel for the latch.\n",
      "He was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him.\n",
      "She measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun, measured the distance from the men to the back room.\n",
      "She decided to risk it.\n",
      "Dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open.\n",
      "In a flash she was away to the back, paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats.\n",
      "It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top.\n",
      "Slowly she turned to face the men again.\n",
      "Keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter, she began to feel her way to the door.\n",
      "As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her, felt him pull her to the safety of his person, she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren.\n",
      "The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them, watched them cross the sidewalk to their car.\n",
      "The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number.\n",
      "I'm sending you a couple of customers -- yeah -- just get them out of my hair and keep them out -- I don't give a damn what you tell them -- only don't believe a word they say -- they're out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them -- I don't care how -- and one more thing -- Cate's Cafe closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and Clarence Corsi left for Quebec yesterday -- some shrine or other -- I think it was called Saint Simon's -- yeah, yesterday.\n",
      "He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant.\n",
      "A line of worry formed, a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side.\n",
      "Grosse muttered, his head down, one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket.\n",
      "`` -- had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents -- I coulda let her go go'' -- His eyes were lowered, so he couldn't have seen the narrow, pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury;;\n",
      "He knew Vince Steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be.\n",
      "sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence.\n",
      "Not really startled, but careful to appear so, Grosse sucked noisily on his pipe.\n",
      "`` Why does everything have to happen to me''??\n",
      "Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar.\n",
      "He got one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter.\n",
      "He returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser.\n",
      "`` -- one word of this gets to Guardino'' --\n",
      "`` You get that kid over to Rose's house''.\n",
      "He ran a finger down his cheek, tracing the scratch there.\n",
      "The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock.\n",
      "`` You and Barney get her over to Rose's before it gets too light.\n",
      "`` What am I going to do with her all day??\n",
      "Vince shouted finally, `` Get her over to Rose's and I'll come by and see that she stays put''.\n",
      "I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid''.\n",
      "Vince lifted his hand as if to strike, but his thin lips spread in a smile.\n",
      "She could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car( she had figured that out), but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions.\n",
      "Who could blame her for that??\n",
      "It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you.\n",
      "Although she found she was thirsty, she was about to refuse( never, never take candy from a strange man) when she saw the bottle was unopened.\n",
      "The man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver's side of a car.\n",
      "He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window.\n",
      "He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe.\n",
      "Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her??\n",
      "And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her??\n",
      "What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours??\n",
      "Her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River Road to LaSalle and, finally, turned in at their own driveway at 387 Heather Heights.\n",
      "Her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful, big, safe, solid shoulder next to her on the front seat.\n",
      "Her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible.\n",
      "I saw that woman's apron behind the door.\n",
      "Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement.\n",
      "He said, `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those'' --\n",
      "He had driven the car that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place.\n",
      "`` I have to get back to Jarrodsville'', he went on.\n",
      "I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town??\n",
      "I'd be happy to pay for the favor, of course''.\n",
      "It was so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened.\n",
      "Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him.\n",
      "There was another on this side, a little further down.\n",
      "And Jarrodsville was more than three miles away, down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire.\n",
      "Marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road.\n",
      "There was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers.\n",
      "For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help.\n",
      "They were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared.\n",
      "On his side of the road there were two farm hands, well back in a field, leaning against a plow.\n",
      "Now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch, too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star.\n",
      "The day's rain had been added to the stagnant water.\n",
      "It was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road, the station wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm.\n",
      "That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road.\n",
      "Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out.\n",
      "The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him, beside a fenced field.\n",
      "It was the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm.\n",
      "It was a narrow road, barely wide enough for two cars to pass.\n",
      "They bore down on him.\n",
      "He jumped, and sank to his knees in muddy water.\n",
      "They would be coming for him next, bearing down on him from both directions.\n",
      "He would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time, all the way to Jarrodsville.\n",
      "He still had three miles to go.\n",
      "He had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence, the section by the farmhouse.\n",
      "He would go in there, climb through the window, and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest.\n",
      "There was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected.\n",
      "He did not dare climb back up to the road.\n",
      "He splashed on, mud sucking at his feet with each step, until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm.\n",
      "He climbed back to the road, and he felt utterly exhausted.\n",
      "And then he saw something that he had not seen before, and panic gripped him again.\n",
      "The fence, his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him, was made of rails, all right, but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it.\n",
      "He lurched on down the road despairingly, because there was no place else to go.\n",
      "Probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse, too, but he did not bother to look.\n",
      "He had to reach Admassy's place.\n",
      "He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there, waiting for them, a perfect target.\n",
      "The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards.\n",
      "He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible.\n",
      "When the Plymouth neared, it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down.\n",
      "He forced himself to stay frozen there.\n",
      "He did not try to run.\n",
      "He was going to make it, he told himself.\n",
      "And then he heard a car coming from the east, and he felt as if he would break down and weep.\n",
      "Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white, and he began to wave his arms frantically.\n",
      "Pete turned around and said to Marty, `` I guess you think I'm a yellow-bellied hound.\n",
      "If I'd stayed, all that I'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head.\n",
      "You must've known I'd gone to get the sheriff.\n",
      "Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke, and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes.\n",
      "Want to try and meet him there''??\n",
      "That wasn't too far from Fifth Street, and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight.\n",
      "`` I hope to Christ.\n",
      "We've got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez''.\n",
      "`` I'd better keep on driving yours'', Shayne decided, `` because I'll be going on over to the Beach.\n",
      "I can drop you back here to pick mine up''.\n",
      "He went to a closet to get a light jacket, and took his hat from beside the door.\n",
      "Timothy Rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him, asking, `` Who are we going to call on in the Northeast section''??\n",
      "At least, I want to find out whether she's home yet or not''.\n",
      "In Rourke's car, Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard and north toward Felice Perrin's address which had been given to him by the Peralta governess.\n",
      "As he drove, he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the Peralta house, and on his own surmises.\n",
      "`` I want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call there'', he ended grimly.\n",
      "`` I don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not, but I want to see who takes the call''.\n",
      "`` This deal at Las Putas Buenas where the two knife-men jumped you'', said Rourke with interest, `` that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious Mrs. Peralta, doesn't it''??\n",
      "`` It does'', Shayne grunted sourly, still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green Jungle parking lot.\n",
      "`` That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony.\n",
      "If it was designed to put me on the spot, it would have to have been written before Peralta ever called me in on the case''.\n",
      "Turn to the left, I think, for that number you gave me.\n",
      "Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached, and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed, indicating that it was occupied.\n",
      "He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said, `` It's the next house, Mike.\n",
      "Instead of pulling into the curb, Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left.\n",
      "Those names mean anything to you''??\n",
      "Maybe with specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her.\n",
      "I'll slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne.\n",
      "You're a reporter, and you're looking for Miss Perrin to interview her.\n",
      "If they are Beach cops on a stake-out, they'll admit it to a reporter.\n",
      "As soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris, come on around to the lounge where I'll be waiting''.\n",
      "`` How often do they add up to headlines??\n",
      "He crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant.\n",
      "I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin''.\n",
      "In exactly three minutes, go in that phone booth behind you and call Police Headquarters.\n",
      "Just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street, and they better send a patrol car.\n",
      "Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address.\n",
      "Will that pay for a pint I can take with me.\n",
      "He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne.\n",
      "As the detective slid it into his pocket, Rourke asked sadly, `` What in hell are you going to do, Mike''??\n",
      "`` Make a couple of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon.\n",
      "Shayne strode out blithely, and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink, getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police.\n",
      "Outside, Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south.\n",
      "He walked over to the right-hand door, opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket.\n",
      "He hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives, but its weight was comforting at his hip.\n",
      "He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached, stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side.\n",
      "The big, paunchy man named Geely was on that side, half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door.\n",
      "Geely grunted and slid partly out, and Shayne's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him, while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big, gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up.\n",
      "Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground, and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster, somewhat impeded by the steering wheel.\n",
      "He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side.\n",
      "He turned, then, to look toward the lighted Boulevard, and saw Rourke's tall, emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side.\n",
      "Shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin lived, and asked casually, `` Get the police okay''??\n",
      "`` They'll have fun explaining that to the Miami cops.\n",
      "There were two front rooms, both dark behind their transoms, and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.\n",
      "Mickey paused with him, waiting, no longer impatient, trying now to think it out, do a little planning.\n",
      "He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk, with the telephone and pen set.\n",
      "I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts --\n",
      "He glanced up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above, literally flying through the air, his bloody face twisted.\n",
      "Mickey tried to flatten against the banister, gripped it with one hand, but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin.\n",
      "He tumbled with Roberts, helpless and in agony, over and over, down the steps.\n",
      "By a wrenching effort, he managed to hunch and draw in, to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head.\n",
      "He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand.\n",
      "He rose stiffly, forcing his knees to lock.\n",
      "The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again.\n",
      "He made himself back off slowly, his eyes wary on Roberts, who now had no more to lose than he.\n",
      "`` You want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this''.\n",
      "Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps.\n",
      "He held the razor well out to one side.\n",
      "He was invulnerable to attack, but he could be handled, Mickey knew, if he could be brought to make the first move.\n",
      "He advanced slowly, directly, giving no hint of a feint to either side.\n",
      "Mickey backed off two steps, forcing him to come on again.\n",
      "This was going to be it now, any second, and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor, no matter what, even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin, the deadly hand was his exclusive concern.\n",
      "Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face, he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly.\n",
      "Ducking, Mickey tripped and fell to one side, landing heavily on the wood floor.\n",
      "He got a knee up into Roberts' belly, used both hands and heaved him clear, then scrambled to his feet.\n",
      "After a minute he went to Roberts, looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse.\n",
      "Roberts appeared to be dead;;\n",
      "It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do.\n",
      "Actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes, and the sum of his reasoning came to this:\n",
      "There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- Wister and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out.\n",
      "The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home, and maybe more than that.\n",
      "They would have to.\n",
      "I'll have to do it myself.\n",
      "It didn't have to be perfect.\n",
      "Walking away on impulse, he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry.\n",
      "He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat.\n",
      "He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby.\n",
      "He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door, went outside and walked back to the garage.\n",
      "He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing.\n",
      "He found the key to the Jeep, got it started and warmed it up for five minutes.\n",
      "Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive.\n",
      "He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat.\n",
      "He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep.\n",
      "He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out, then returned to the porch and closed the front door, making sure it was unlocked.\n",
      "When he reached the dip in the woods, he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible.\n",
      "He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine.\n",
      "He went back and got the flashlight, returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier.\n",
      "When the dust settled, he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder.\n",
      "Inside the passage, he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden.\n",
      "He stood looking down for a few seconds, then backed up two or three paces from the edge.\n",
      "There was too much weight casually to toss it away.\n",
      "He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out.\n",
      "It would be a bad place to die.\n",
      "It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up, but Roberts had asked for it.\n",
      "It was too late to worry about that.\n",
      "It was a relief to get rid of the weight.\n",
      "He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down.\n",
      "He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit.\n",
      "The external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow, probably by the next day.\n",
      "It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact.\n",
      "He made his way back to the Jeep.\n",
      "He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket.\n",
      "He climbed down, went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit.\n",
      "It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh, poised precariously, then slid off to the ground.\n",
      "He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel.\n",
      "Liz Peabody, he thought, might spend some time grieving for her lost lover, but he doubted that she would launch an investigation.\n",
      "He judged her to be a woman of some pride, though not much sense.\n",
      "Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who, apparently, had run away.\n",
      "He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room.\n",

      "He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving.\n",
      "`` Come on, let's hurry down before they lock up for the day''.\n",
      "In the basement the sheriff took him to a small, dingy office occupied by a tall, thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves.\n",

      "Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half.\n",
      "Before we built the new jail, we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded.\n",
      "He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big, leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls.\n",
      "`` They're all here, back to 1865'', Carruthers told him.\n",

      "An old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him.\n",
      "From reconstruction to moon rockets.\n",
      "But he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones.\n",
      "Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf.\n",
      "Since Mrs. Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring, he started to plod through several months.\n",
      "He tried to turn right to the society page in each one, but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him.\n",
      "It told him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered, stating that it had been a small, modest wedding compared to some of the others.\n",
      "Mr. Black's life was an open book, so to speak, from his birth in Jackson, Mississippi, through his basketball-playing days at L.S.U. and his attainment of a B.A. degree, which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless Business Machines.\n",
      "Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black.\n",
      "If Mrs. Black was who he thought she was, Mr. Black's Peerless selling days might well be over.\n",
      "This time the search took twice as long, cutting down on his extra reading, for he had to pick through several columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue.\n",
      "The item said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson, his home town -- so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago.\n",
      "Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent Black was still with them -- or, more specifically, still with us.\n",
      "He glanced at his watch, saw it was only seven, and decided to indulge his weakness now.\n",
      "For the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder, sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinley's assassination, the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago, and the Hall-Mills trial.\n",
      "He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing.\n",
      "The light shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond -- enough for him to see there was no one there.\n",
      "He thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around, figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up.\n",
      "Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here, had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted.\n",
      "`` I take a little time to think it over''.\n",
      "There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over.\n",
      "And I done favors for you, big favor not so long back, didn't I, and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off.\n",
      "Acourse there's this deal o' Denny's -- and Jackie's -- kinda hangin' fire, ain't it, maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that.\n",

      "Oh, God, the name repeated over and over, anybody to hear -- Not being a fool, Mr. Skyros knew why.\n",

      "It's awkward, you see that, isn't it''??\n",
      "`` Well, that's your business, Mr. Skyros'', said Angie, and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window.\n",
      "`` I appreciate it, you do that.\n",
      "A couple decks for me, Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell, see, I like to have a little ready cash''.\n",

      "Fifty a throw, that the deal??\n",

      "He was not a superstitious man, but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that, indeed.\n",
      "He rather wished he had never got into the business, and still -- scarcely to be resisted, a nice little profit with not much work involved, easy money\n",
      "She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks.\n",
      "Usually she marked the few who did thank you, you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and she played a little game with herself, seeing how downright rude she could act to the others, before they'd take offense, threaten to call the manager.\n",
      "Funny how seldom they did: used to it, probably.\n",
      "Grab, snatch, I saw that first!!\n",
      "Never have to.\n",
      "She'd be smart about it, get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that, the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait.\n",
      "No need say anything at all to the old woman.\n",
      "She'd say she didn't feel good on Sunday, couldn't go to church -- there'd be a little argument, but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone, quick pack the things she'd need to take, all but the dress she'd wear Monday, and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight, for a dime.\n",
      "Then on Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time, and last thing, put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer.\n",
      "She wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left, go do the daily shopping.\n",
      "No need leave a note with it, either -- or maybe just something like, Don't worry about me, I'm going away to make a better life.\n",
      "She didn't mind working hard, not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance, where she wasn't marked as what she was.\n",
      "To be Katharine Ross, and work in a nicer shop somewhere, at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes, and learn ladies' manners and all like that, and get to know different people than up to now, not just the ones like her here, with foreign-sounding names, the ones went to the same church and -- Different place, different job, different people, she'd be all different too.\n",
      "smarter, and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross, just what that sounded like.\n",
      "She was listening to other voices, out of the future.\n",
      "Oh, Katharine's awfully nice, and pretty too, I like Katharine -- Let's ask Katharine to go with us, she's always lots of fun -- Katharine --\n",
      "It was going to be another hot day;;\n",
      "already the thermometer stood close to ninety.\n",
      "He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today, and drove home.\n",
      "After he'd got out fresh liver for Bast, he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish.\n",
      "He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters, and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens.\n",
      "`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats, it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and, damn it, you know very well if I have them around long, impossible to give them away!!\n",
      "And I suppose now that you've finally grown up, if a little late, you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so.\n",
      "Yes, well, it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more.\n",
      "And it's no good looking at me like that'', as she wound affectionately around his ankles.\n",
      "`` Happened to be in the hall!!\n",
      "Happened to hear you quarrel about her!!\n",
      "Oh, well, you can't really blame Lolotte.\n",
      "She lost her beau to you''.\n",
      "`` I've got to get busy.\n",
      "Miss Celie's taken to her bed, with the door locked.\n",
      "She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you.\n",
      "`` Not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now.\n",
      "Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat.\n",
      "Well -- I'll take it down with me as I go''.\n",
      "Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start.\n",
      "It's just like that book your Northern friend wrote -- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds''.\n",
      "It's silly, childish, running after them like that.\n",
      "But of course the paterollers won't be of any help, not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around, God knows where''.\n",
      "She had swished away, she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her, pour out the coffee, so no one would drink it.\n",
      "But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best, cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup!!\n",
      "She was deeply, horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium.\n",
      "Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.\n",
      "She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans.\n",
      "It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.\n",
      "It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her.\n",
      "He didn't even know that she was there.\n",
      "And he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding -- yes, and credible fool he had every right to expect.\n",
      "Her skin crawled: Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open.\n",
      "Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile, she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door, open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall.\n",
      "So Lolotte -- or anybody -- could have listened, and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium.\n",
      "She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup.\n",
      "So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her, so she would leave Honotassa!!\n",
      "Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot, she might even have drunk some of it, she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her, for she would have been warned by its taste.\n",
      "It was merely an attempt to frighten her.\n",
      "She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested;;\n",
      "But -- well, she'd be very careful.\n",
      "She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life.\n",
      "So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died.\n",
      "Rev didn't need to break the wax seal, read the contract and find out.\n",
      "He could conceivably have wished to make sure;;\n",
      "Rev would never have tried to give her poison!!\n",
      "She went downstairs and received another curious shock, for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins, Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't.\n",
      "`` Too much work this morning, Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that'' --\n",
      "She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you''.\n",
      "Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice.\n",
      "I don't know what we're going to do, Miss Sarah''.\n",
      "`` We've got to eat'', Sarah said, curtly, because a chill crawled over her again.\n",
      "`` We'll go to the storehouse''.\n",
      "Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers, and went with her through the drizzle, to the storehouse.\n",
      "It was a long, low room, like a root cellar, for it was banked up with soil, and vines had run rampant over that, too.\n",
      "there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with.\n",
      "She took Glendora to the smokehouse, unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon, hanging from the smoke-stained rafters.\n",
      "`` Can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like, here''??\n",
      "She sent Glendora back to the house, her basket and her apron laden.\n",
      "Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room.\n",
      "Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do.\n",
      "She couldn't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her.\n",
      "Besides, there was something hysterical and silly, something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her.\n",
      "Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York.\n",
      "Maude could have shot Emile -- if she'd had a reason to kill him.\n",
      "There was no use in standing there in the drizzle, trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium in a cup of coffee.\n",
      "A lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky, drizzling day.\n",
      "George said, `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again, is get me a Yankee'' --\n",
      "There was no way to know, no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah's appearance, believing her to be drugged and senseless -- and just possibly dead.\n",
      "He turned to George and Lolotte.\n",
      "I want to talk to Sarah''.\n",
      "I mean I've got to -- to see to the kitchen.\n",
      "Now why did I do that??\n",
      "She was no schoolgirl, refusing to bear tales.\n",
      "It might be, indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love, but it was marriage.\n",
      "Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium, she thought, as coldly and sharply, again, as Maude might have said it.\n",
      "She paused at the kitchen door, caught her breath, told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen, where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp chimneys.\n",
      "Again the homely, everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her.\n",
      "No matter what had happened or hadn't happened, somebody had to see about dinner.\n",
      "I didn't think there was any reason to''.\n",
      "Speak to him again anyway.\n",
      "Try talking to some of the fellows he works with, friends, anyone.\n",
      "Try to find out how happy he is with his wife, whether he plays around with women.\n",
      "She might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been having any trouble''.\n",
      "I'm on my way to see the Jacobs woman''.\n",
      "I just don't want to go off half-cocked before picking up Black, that's all''.\n",
      "I'd like to make sure.\n",
      "`` Aren't you ever going to go home''??\n",
      "I'm telling you, if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to, they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off''.\n",
      "`` Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet''.\n",
      "Thirty years' experience let him know, even at this early stage, that Black was his man.\n",
      "But he still wanted to know why.\n",
      "It was a cold, windy day, the day after Kitti's death, but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind.\n",
      "He stopped automatically at the street corners, waiting for the traffic lights to change, unheeding of other people, his coat open and flapping.\n",
      "As he walked, he tried to think.\n",
      "Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe.\n",
      "The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept, with any degree of realism, the actuality of it.\n",
      "Kitti had come along to justify everything.\n",
      "Not once, in the time that he had known her, had he ever considered the possibility, not once, not for one one-thousandth of a second, of her infidelity.\n",
      "The doorman began to nod his head automatically, then remembered who Gilborn was, what had happened to him the night before.\n",
      "There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been.\n",
      "Except that Kitti wasn't there.\n",
      "At last, sitting there, in the familiar surroundings, the truth began to sink in.\n",
      "He felt no anger towards Kitti, no sense that she had betrayed him.\n",
      "Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who??\n",
      "The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter.\n",
      "She wanted to be with him, to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed.\n",
      "She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out.\n",
      "She tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all.\n",
      "He had taken her upstairs to say good night.\n",
      "It was in the kitchen, as she was watching the kettle, waiting for the water to boil, that he had grabbed for her.\n",
      "Without warning, without giving her a chance to prepare for it.\n",
      "From behind, he had put his arms on her shoulders, turned her around, and pressed her to him, so close she couldn't breathe.\n",
      "Later, she apologized for the long scratch across his face, tried to explain she couldn't help herself, that the panic arose in her unwanted.\n",
      "Stanley wasn't like that.\n",
      "She could always predict what Stanley was going to do, ever since she first met him.\n",
      "Except for that one morning.\n",
      "The morning he walked in to announce to her, blushing, that he was married.\n",
      "She thought she was going to die.\n",
      "She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him.\n",
      "It was nothing that he said or did, but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him, looking forward to his eventual proposal.\n",
      "But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's continued carping, had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony.\n",
      "It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy, slow in taking such a momentous step.\n",
      "Stanley went along in life, she knew, convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman.\n",
      "But one day, she expected, he would somehow discover, without her having to tell him, that there was such a woman in the world;;\n",
      "a woman who was willing to give him love, faith, and anything else a woman could give a husband.\n",
      "On that first day, Blanche literally thought she was going to die, or, at the very least, go out of her mind.\n",
      "It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been everything that Blanche was not.\n",
      "Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley, taller than Stanley, prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for, much less expect.\n",
      "There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn, there was no need for her to marry Stanley.\n",
      "Stanley had filled out the return and because, when he was finished, it was close to the lunch hour, he had politely asked Kitti to join him, never expecting her to accept.\n",
      "Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley's office was open and, without straining too hard, she could hear everything that was said.\n",
      "After that day, Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened.\n",
      "Somehow, Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations.\n",
      "For exactly one week, she was able to continue in this manner.\n",
      "Two hours of watching his serenely happy face, listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures, and Blanche had to leave.\n",
      "Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known.\n",
      "She refused to have a doctor, insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her.\n",
      "`` Also, if you're going to believe those prints, you'll have to look for a killer who's a top-grade piano player''.\n",
      "To make it clearer he shifted to acting out, but with no change of manner, the killing of Rose Mallory.\n",
      "His hands snatched at an imaginary bucket, swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard.\n",
      "In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that, pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that.\n",
      "If Rose Mallory's killer acted this way, catching up with him was going to be a cinch.\n",
      "Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment, we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness.\n",
      "By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon, which, one would think, would be late enough so that by then, except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up, it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats.\n",
      "He had retained his hat and his horn, and, whatever fun might still be going, he was ready to join it.\n",
      "After all, he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning.\n",
      "The meat wagon, therefore, was not out in front of the house any more, but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings.\n",
      "There was, furthermore, the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance.\n",
      "You still have your paper hat and you're wearing it, but then, it is an extraordinary paper hat and, in addition to anything else you may be, you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard.\n",
      "It's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen.\n",
      "You have your paper horn clutched in your big, craggy fist, and for your entrance you have planned a noisy, colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants.\n",
      "Can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn??\n",
      "You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door.\n",
      "Then he turns back to you.\n",
      "Even then, as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable, official control, could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand??\n",
      "What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix's being an odd one.\n",
      "We were not, however, prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs.\n",
      "He adjusted the hat, lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute, and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him.\n",
      "Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house.\n",
      "I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures.\n",
      "His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck.\n",
      "A man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five.\n",
      "For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement.\n",
      "We waited till he had finished laughing, and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him.\n",
      "`` You always live up to your name, always like this, always making happy''??\n",
      "I've never noticed that it improves things any''.\n",
      "`` The past I leave to historians'', Felix intoned, demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy.\n",
      "Could your future, your immediate future, be made to include taking us upstairs, giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work, and making available to him your finger tips''??\n",
      "Gibby asked, not bothering to whisper.\n",
      "`` I can't see what would make it necessary for you to know.\n",
      "Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world''.\n",
      "Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty, he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible.\n",
      "The cops would gather up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting.\n",
      "You may think we didn't need Nancy and Jean, but you always get what you can when you can, and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case.\n",
      "Also, if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood.\n",
      "The killer, if in our present group, would certainly be interested in knowing that much, and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation, there might always be some way.\n",
      "It was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house, where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope.\n",
      "He quickly fixed that, rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others.\n",
      "He flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience.\n",
      "Starting with the room completely blacked out, as it was when we came in, he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare.\n",
      "Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort, convenience and efficiency.\n",
      "It was still a very big world, despite all the modern cant to the contrary.\n",
      "Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door.\n",
      "He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance.\n",
      "Lot of people waiting to see you, though''.\n",
      "You want me to call her''??\n",
      "`` She expecting me to''??\n",
      "Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother.\n",
      "The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted.\n",
      "they had nothing to give to each other.\n",
      "The omission might look peculiar to outsiders, but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances.\n",
      "He had little time to himself, anyway.\n",
      "Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle Song'' in case it was needed.\n",
      "Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions, first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement -- they decided it was wise -- and later to announce that a prominent comedian, also an agency client, had agreed to fill the casino's open date.\n",
      "And once Bake slipped in, pale and drawn, last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it.\n",
      "Andy invented a job to keep him busy, sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements.\n",
      "At last it was time to depart.\n",
      "They had come not to admire but to observe.\n",
      "But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read, `` We're with you all the way''.\n",
      "He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board.\n",
      "Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently.\n",
      "Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment.\n",
      "Andy told him, `` Bake, I wish you'd talk to Skolman, see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside.\n",
      "It's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get a table.\n",

      "It wasn't what Mae would want him to do, though.\n",
      "Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst, once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense, there wouldn't be very much for Mae to do.\n",

      "that there were three children, two boys and a girl;;\n",

      "There was no telling how she'd react to spending money''.\n",
      "The lawyer didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party -- Thayer, like himself, Madden reflected, was the extra man so prized by hostesses -- and found him easy enough to talk to.\n",
      "But he didn't play golf, didn't seem to belong to any local clubs -- his work took him away a lot, of course -- which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself.\n",

      "He said that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker.\n",
      "He would offer no theory to account for her murder.\n",
      "The whole thing, his manner conveyed, was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug.\n",
      "It would be all right with him, he decided, if his investigation of the fraud, with its probable by-product of murder, led to Garth's door.\n",
      "The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking.\n",
      "Nevertheless, he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background.\n",
      "In Dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month;;\n",

      "`` What happened to your head''??\n",
      "`` He says I'm to take the message''.\n",

      "Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer''.\n",
      "Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it.\n",
      "`` So that proves it''!!\n",
      "`` Where is that''??\n",
      "`` Listen to me, Leigh.\n",
      "If you want to spend another day in the State Department -- another day -- you get in there and tell that captain what I told you''.\n",
      "On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty, didn't see him, and accepted a glass of champagne.\n",
      "He took several large swallows, recollected that Docherty had gone up another flight, and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him.\n",
      "He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing.\n",
      "He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him.\n",
      "Griffith said, `` Hoag told me to tell you'' -- he waited until they were close;;\n",
      "it was hideously embarrassing -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer''.\n",
      "Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain;;\n",
      "`` He claims Mahzeer's in a plot to kill the P.M.''.\n",
      "he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter.\n",
      "And if by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man, he wouldn't dare try anything now -- not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well.\n",
      "One more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away.\n",
      "Still, this had to be checked out.\n",
      "I'd like to talk to him''.\n",
      "He was unwilling to rely on Griffith's carrying his message, and he had no confidence the police would act on it.\n",
      "He would have to do something on his own.\n",
      "The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.\n",
      "If Mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes.\n",
      "Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building.\n",
      "Mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side.\n",
      "Hoag would carry its sound to his grave.\n",
      "How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance??\n",
      "Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite.\n",
      "With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all, and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport.\n",
      "Hoag crossed the narrow street, squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.\n",
      "He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out;;\n",
      "He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.\n",
      "He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments, but this one, from a glance at the hall furnishings, was obviously still a functioning town house, and its owners were in residence;;\n",
      "that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.\n",
      "He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.\n",
      "The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.\n",
      "This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.\n",
      "all were empty except one, and that one was jammed with letters and magazines.\n",
      "The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days, and not likely to return on a Friday.\n",
      "Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.\n",
      "He climbed, as quickly as he could urge his body, up the two unbroken flights to the third floor, pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade, all that remained of the building's beauty.\n",
      "He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead.\n",
      "Now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys;;\n",
      "fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open.\n",
      "he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.\n",
      "What was he to do now??\n",
      "He realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him -- that Muller would not be here, that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag's control.\n",
      "He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.\n",
      "he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.\n",
      "He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight, dismissing Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at Hoag's apartment.\n",
      "Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.\n",
      "Muller, nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights, threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table;;\n",
      "Hoag stumbled back into the hall, leaned against the wall, and started to retch.\n",
      "After Captain Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned, buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.\n",
      "The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harris's office( to the left), the lieutenant's office( farther along and to the left) and the janitor's supply closet( straight ahead).\n",
      "Gun set the captain's fifth of Hiram Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt. Killpath, though he knew that Killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman Wolff's gift.\n",
      "He walked up to the lieutenant's office, leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range.\n",
      "Gun went to the connecting door, which was open, and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath, in full uniform, finished combing his hair.\n",
      "The lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded, and as Killpath raked the comb through it, it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull.\n",
      "Because I'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man, and I'm going to get him.\n",
      "If you just leave me to hell alone, Lieutenant.\n",
      "Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window.\n",
      "He sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel, though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair.\n",
      "Killpath pulled one thin leg up, clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut.\n",
      "It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer.\n",
      "He put his chin on his kneecap, stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block, and stared wordlessly at his sergeant.\n",
      "He was silent again, possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom.\n",
      "Killpath said, `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago, Sergeant.\n",
      "Gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time.\n",
      "`` Sir, Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief.\n",
      "Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool.\n",
      "He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk.\n",
      "`` I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped''.\n",
      "Gun knew it was Car 12, the wagon, returned from delivering Ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail.\n",
      "He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again, wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then, eying the report as it lay before him on the desk, intoned, `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six'' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered.\n",
      "What have you to say to that, Sergeant''??\n",
      "Gun held his breath a moment, pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat.\n",
      "I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot, if I'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district.\n",
      "It's too bad I didn't call you, and it's too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure.\n",
      "But I'm not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around, and'' --\n",
      "`` I shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty''.\n",
      "He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out.\n",
      "`` Let's just remember, Sergeant, that we must all carry our own umbrella.\n",
      "It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers didn't work, that Loren Severe had thrown up all over the stairs, or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes.\n",
      "It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath's office.\n",
      "Now, as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office, he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks, not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out.\n"

      "then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious, and as the thought expanded, the implications jarred him.\n",
      "It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him.\n",
      "The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket.\n",
      "And that gun was empty.\n",
      "He considered them with brooding eyes, brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution.\n",
      "He put the shells on the table, as though he could no longer bear to hold them.\n",
      "There was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room, his imagination out of control.\n",
      "He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense.\n",
      "Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer, whoever he was, in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough.\n",
      "He thought of other possibilities, none of them satisfactory, and finally he began to think, to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton.\n",
      "Then, as he turned toward the telephone, it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly.\n",
      "Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was, but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head.\n",
      "When he heard Calenda say: `` What about that picture you took this afternoon''??\n",
      "It still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly.\n",
      "Casey believed that much.\n",
      "`` With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that picture published''.\n",
      "`` Who says it's going to be published''??\n",
      "`` I wouldn't even want it to get around''.\n",
      "Under normal circumstances Casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken.\n",
      "Even so, he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly.\n",
      "Right now, however, he was still too worried about Jerry Burton, and the gun that had no bullets, and the story Burton had told him, to care too much about Tony Calenda.\n",
      "`` I was hired to take a picture.\n",
      "If that picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it, I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you''.\n",
      "`` You do that'', Casey said.\n",
      "`` Just be sure to send your two best boys, Tony''.\n",
      "He hung up with a bang, annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create.\n",
      "He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up.\n",
      "He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon.\n",
      "When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then, he thought of three other places that were possibilities.\n",
      "By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down.\n",
      "He had done all he could and that was that.\n",
      "And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk.\n",
      "He, Casey, had been scared for a while, but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible.\n",
      "He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink.\n",
      "He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too.\n",
      "Finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes.\n",
      "When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent.\n",
      "If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can.\n",
      "Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth, and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision.\n",
      "A few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break.\n",
      "Only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony, and, like the police, Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time.\n",
      "He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes, and it took him only three more to reach the corner, a block from Columbus Avenue.\n",
      "He did not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned.\n",
      "Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl, and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another, tune in the null, then draw in a line on the chart.\n",
      "`` Reverse'', Elaine said, then peered through the loop of the RDF and waved to Poet.\n",
      "All had fallen into a complete silence, listening to the wind whistle over the wings.\n",
      "He'd landed the plane on a small airstrip in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted to a stop, everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment.\n",
      "a tension similar to the one now.\n",
      "Now, at this moment, there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe.\n",
      "`` It's quite possible there's more than codfish down there, man'', Poet replied with a short, nervous laugh as he held the harness for Elaine.\n",
      "A moment later, moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins, she picked up the gun, handed the knife to Poet, then rolled off the transom of the boat, back first.\n",
      "Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion.\n",
      "Another moment and they were out of sight, leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts.\n",
      "Next to the ocean, probably the loneliest spot was the desert.\n",
      "If Elaine's uncle had stuck to this desire for aloneness, he probably would still be alive.\n",
      "Yet Alfredo wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts.\n",
      "And Graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in Las Vegas.\n",
      "It was an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the Trinidad.\n",
      "Two to three weeks prior to the charter of the Virginia, Graham had been snooping around the San Luis Rey Mission.\n",
      "The small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and Nick raised up to watch it heading south.\n",
      "A couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them.\n",
      "If the character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful.\n",
      "Off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind, headed on a tack toward San Clemente.\n",
      "Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep and the Redondo Deep, two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline.\n",
      "Meanwhile, fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers.\n",
      "Strolling down to the galley, he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated, poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom.\n",
      "Turning on the hi-fi, he went back to the cockpit, stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music.\n",
      "`` Which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile'', she added as she swung her legs over the transom.\n",
      "His feet still hung over the stern of the transom, but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in.\n",
      "The word hissed distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet.\n",
      "Turning quickly toward Elaine, Nick saw that she, too, stood in shocked surprise.\n",
      "And then Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine, himself and Poet.\n",
      "Elaine recovered first, so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction.\n",
      "`` It's like banging a shin'', he said, his eyes lingered on Nick's face, then moved back to Elaine.\n",
      "The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine.\n",
      "The moment the sea closed over Nick, some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic.\n",
      "But the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage.\n",
      "The wide flippers on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power, driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over.\n",
      "Poet was the captured, arms pinioned to his side, and he twisted convulsively trying to escape.\n",
      "A sharp pain lanced across Nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs, joining dozens of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising into the sky.\n",
      "At the same instant, he grabbed the loose, writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece.\n",
      "As if this was a signal, Poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water.\n",
      "Relentlessly, Nick held on, sucking on the hose, inhaling the air that belonged to Poet.\n",
      "a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age.\n",
      "Seeing me he said with real surprise, `` Well, well, ain't we honored!!\n",
      "Took me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force.\n",
      "`` I guess it helps'', I said, paying no attention to his ribbing.\n",
      "`` Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop, Jed.\n",
      "You're not only young but well, you don't even look like a police officer.\n",
      "A runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut hell, you'd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set.\n",
      "In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law, big and tough.\n",
      "Also, it's far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come You've had your gassy lecture, let's get to work.\n",
      "Came to the Harbor as a bride and Don't worry Jed, this one is in the bag.\n",
      "Tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the South last year, but Tim and his wife settled here.\n",
      "Never had no trouble with him before, thought he was a hard worker, hustling around to get a full week's work.\n",
      "Anyway, Julia asks me to.\n",
      "`` Julia asks me to come out at once.\n",
      "Don't know why the County had to send anybody up here.\n",
      "Nellie was in the kitchen, had just come to work, when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room.\n",
      "Swears she recognized his voice, that Tim yelled,' It's my money and I want it'!!\n",
      "And before you say it, Nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled Julia.\n",
      "Guess you want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc Abel's office''.\n",
      "We walked up Main Street to this big white house, then around to the back.\n",
      "Still, I wanted to get this over with, had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office.\n",
      "I told him, `` I want to go see the Buck house''.\n",
      "Walking back down Main Street, I said, `` I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block, we'll ride out in my car''.\n",
      "Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house, and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow.\n",
      "When I asked, `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was''??\n",
      "Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security, so's I wouldn't have to be working now, Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her''.\n",
      "There didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle.\n",
      "Look Jed, this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road block soon.\n",
      "We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks.\n",
      "In late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these.\n",
      "The inside of their place was full of new furniture, five bucks down and a buck a week stuff, but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home.\n",
      "Listen, Mr. Inspector, no matter what anybody say, my Tim didn't kill that woman!!\n",
      "He never in his life took a hand to a woman or''\n",
      "Moore said, `` Come on, Jed, I have to get to my men''.\n",
      "On my way out I told her, `` If you should eh just happen to see your husband, get him to give himself up.\n",
      "We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes.\n",
      "I tried not to act scared.\n",
      "I told Moore I was going to eat, get some forms filled out by Doc Abel.\n",
      "Even now, there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock, an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater.\n",
      "As I was walking back to the Police Station, which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office, I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into the back of my car.\n",
      "For another moment we didn't talk, then she began to weep.\n",
      "She mumbled, `` I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim''!!\n",
      "I want you to go to Pearson City and find out why -- first-hand stuff for your modern crime series.\n",
      "Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite -- 1105''.\n",
      "To the hotel people, you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite''.\n",
      "`` Still, they may not want to rent it''.\n",
      "Ten to one, it's even been redecorated''!!\n",
      "`` I'm betting on that chance.\n",
      "Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive''.\n",
      "`` Cheerful way to spend an evening''!!\n",
      "`` Suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime''!!\n",
      "And the key to the suite is still missing''.\n",
      "Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City.\n",
      "She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel Westmore.\n",
      "She telephoned the junior partner of her law firm, Martin Stacy, and asked him to call at her hotel that evening.\n",
      "At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried.\n",
      "According to Stacy, she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum.\n",
      "Stacy replied that it would bankrupt Forbes, who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture.\n",
      "She was in good health and spirits, but still determined to get the money from Forbes.\n",
      "No other visitor inquired for her that evening.\n",
      "According to the medical examiner, she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m..\n",
      "When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk.\n",
      "The Hotel Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City, and definitely second-rate.\n",
      "Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk.\n",
      "`` It's just that -- well, 1105 is being redecorated''.\n",
      "Show this gentleman to 1105''!!\n",
      "The stillness persisted as Alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator.\n",
      "He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly.\n",
      "A few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow, languid as falling feathers.\n",
      "The mirror over the bureau was a blank eye, round and innocent.\n"

      "And later in the same week they both came together to examine the register.\n",

      "Not that I intentionally go unperceived, but the boulders up there are very high and I am a small woman.\n",

      "Very suddenly, the driver stopped swearing at them, turned on his heel and went back to his truck.\n",
      "Now he recalled it very clearly, and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off.\n",
      "It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word.\n",
      "And when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars, he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them.\n",
      "Phil usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.\n",
      "Phil was like that.\n",
      "He really didn't take the offer seriously, but he began to feel uneasy.\n",
      "When he finally got the coughing under control, he realized that Pete( all he gave was his first name) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare.\n",
      "I might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you.\n",
      "He was beginning to feel woolly.\n",
      "Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit.\n",
      "He really didn't expect anything to come of it, and there were a few people\n",

      "Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently, and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.\n",
      "Phil decided to stay a little longer, and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there, but for the other glass on the table.\n",

      "if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine.\n",
      "I said, `` Wait'', and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink.\n",
      "When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely, Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now'', to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket, once.\n",
      "and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him.\n",
      "I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat, but Charlie said `` Wait''!!\n",
      "He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.\n",
      "`` We don't want to know whether he's dead, yet.\n",

      "We've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent.\n",
      "Let's do that''.\n",
      "We did that and found a dirty handkerchief, some matches and fourteen cents in change.\n",
      "We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out.\n",
      "The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out.\n",
      "A fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner.\n",

      "Less than three hours ago we'd decided, in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo, to commit a trial murder.\n",
      "Almost too smoothly, I found myself thinking, and then told myself that was ridiculous.\n",
      "Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad.\n",

      "Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first??\n",
      "We'll need some at least, if only bus fare to the scene of the crime.\n",
      "And if you're as flat broke as I am, I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work''.\n",

      "he studied them, compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling, struggling to bridge between languages, the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in.\n",
      "there was no Martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church'' and `` worship'' and `` God'' and `` congregation'' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected( by each differently) by Jubal, by Mahmoud, by Digby.\n",
      "He was closer to understanding it in English now, although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood for.\n",

      "Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches.\n",

      "Meanwhile, all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship, went into the suspensor.\n",
      "They would sleep while the Gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured.\n",

      "His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen.\n",
      "It was true that they could be approximated, but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations??\n",
      "Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future, Siddo used an entirely different word.\n",
      "Thus, the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai, meaning to live, was, in the perfect tense, ksu'u'peli'afo, and, in the future, mai'teipa.\n",

      "Now there could be an end to pretending.\n",
      "He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk, to the floor.\n",
      "There was no longer any need to hide.\n",
      "But what was there to do??\n",
      "He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night, his eyes closed, pretending to sleep.\n",
      "Actually, they said, he did sleep, but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot.\n",
      "His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons.\n",
      "He had to hide it.\n",

      "Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began.\n",
      "As she matured, more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship.\n",
      "For Helva was destined to be the `` brain'' half of a scout ship, partnered with a man or a woman, whichever she chose, as the mobile half.\n",
      "As long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations, and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering, Helva would live a rewarding, rich and unusual life, a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary, `` normal'' being.\n",
      "However, no diagram of her brain patterns, no early I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn.\n",
      "They would have to bide their official time and see, trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her, too, as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession.\n",
      "A ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships.\n",
      "Most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small, eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells.\n",
      "And very, very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine.\n",
      "So, for happy years, Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates, playing such games as Stall, Power-Seek, studying her lessons in trajectory, propulsion techniques, computation, logistics, mental hygiene, basic alien psychology, philology, space history, law, traffic, codes: all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning, logical, informed citizen.\n",
      "Not so obvious to her, but of more importance to her teachers, Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid.\n",
      "She would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.\n",
      "Helva's civilization was not without busy, do-good associations, exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens.\n",
      "When they were forced to, Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders, arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories, complete with photographs.\n",
      "Most of their original objections about `` shells'' were overridden by the relief that these hideous( to them) bodies were mercifully concealed.\n",
      "She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel.\n",
      "She had tuned her sight to the proper degree.\n",
      "Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people, she took this experience calmly.\n",
      "`` I meant that you have a nice singing voice dear'', the lady amended.\n",
      "Would you like to see my work''??\n",
      "Helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically.\n",
      "`` Of course, some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy''.\n",
      "In a kind of shock, the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of a screw.\n",
      "`` Well'', remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife, `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread''.\n",
      "`` Are you referring, sir'', asked Helva politely, `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin''??\n",
      "`` I had that in mind''.\n",
      "`` Which you are programed to compute''??\n",
      "`` Did they remember to program a sense of humor, as well, young lady''??\n",
      "`` We are directed to develop a sense of proportion, sir, which contributes the same effect''.\n",
      "If the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School, they left Helva with a morsel as well.\n",
      "`` Singing'' as applicable to herself required research.\n",
      "She had, of course, been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` Tristan und Isolde'', `` Candide'', `` Oklahoma'', `` Nozze de Figaro'', the atomic age singers, Eileen Farrell, Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd, as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians, Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians.\n",
      "But `` singing'' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome.\n",
      "Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis.\n",
      "Balanced properly between optimism and practicality, the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves, their ships and personnel, from bizarre situations.\n",
      "Therefore to Helva, the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing, among other restrictions, did not bother her.\n",
      "Breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice.\n",
      "After experimentation, Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone.\n",
      "By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses, she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone.\n",
      "Acquiring a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall.\n",
      "She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy.\n",
      "It would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano and coloratura as she pleased.\n",
      "It was, to Helva, only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted.\n",
      "Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work.\n",
      "Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed.\n",
      "There were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section.\n",
      "Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners.\n",
      "Had there been another `` brain'' ship at the Base at the moment, Helva would have been guided to make the first move.\n",
      "As it was, while Central wrangled among itself, Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks, out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull.\n",
      "`` All you have to do is ask'', he retorted hopefully.\n",
      "Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely, sitting on the darkened field.\n",
      "`` No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret, but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you, you beautiful thing''.\n",
      "Mercer stammered, not knowing what B'dikkat meant, and the two-nosed man answered for him, `` I think he has a nice baby head, but it isn't big enough for you to take yet''.\n",
      "B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer.\n",
      "He tried to run after B'dikkat, to hug the lead spacesuit, to tell B'dikkat that he loved him.\n",
      "Mercer spoke to her.\n",
      "I'm so happy to be here''.\n",
      "Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming.\n",
      "It was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.\n",
      "With one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing, just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it.\n",
      "He wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this.\n",
      "He tried to tell the Lady Da, but the words weren't quite straight.\n",
      "He forced himself to be deliberate.\n",
      "He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert, `` That was a good bite.\n",
      "In that beautiful place, among all those companionable and attractive people, he sat and smiled.\n",
      "After a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms.\n",
      "Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion, closed his eyes briefly, and opened them to see stars shining.\n",
      "He remembered them well from his happy period.\n",
      "He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug, and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again.\n",
      "She meant him well, but was in no condition for articulate speech.\n",
      "``' A good morrow to you, my boy.\n",
      "`` I never saw that'', said Mercer, `` but I'' --\n",
      "`` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle''.\n",
      "We all know what is going to happen.\n",
      "We all know when it is going to happen.\n",
      "But we never know how long a scene is going to take''.\n",
      "`` Is that the name for the needle''??\n",
      "The half-man laughed with something close to real humor.\n",
      "I mean we know the order in which things happen, but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here, so none of us know how long anything takes.\n",
      "I'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each''.\n",
      "Mercer did not know what an `` Earth-week'' was, since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction, but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time.\n",
      "When Mercer looked on helplessly, the half-man twisted over on his side, his pink dusty back turned to Mercer, and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself.\n",
      "When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh, he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body.\n",
      "Or was that after the torso and legs, waist to toe-tips, of the little girl which had grown from his side??\n",
      "but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him, repeated some thousands of time, repeated with smiles and hope, `` People never live forever''.\n",
      "Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones, resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains, in a ground-truck to be added to other herds.\n",
      "Finally, Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin.\n",
      "He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it.\n",
      "Only the memory of previous hurt, bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he, Mercer, was happy, the answer would no longer be available when he needed it.\n",
      "Fighting pleasure itself, he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there.\n",
      "He spoke through the public address box built into the cabin, and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain, so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them.\n",
      "When he said it, they thought it exceedingly profound, though none of them understood it, since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on Shayol:\n",
      "What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol??\n",
      "Was B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day, surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself??\n",
      "He staggered back to the group.\n",
      "The Lady Da, naked in the dusty plain, waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her.\n",
      "Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men;;\n",
      "those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez.\n",
      "Time stood still for these people, and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning.\n",
      "They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses, to exchange names with each other, to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all.\n",
      "Though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond B'dikkat's cabin, they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh.\n",
      "Far long ago, some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter.\n",
      "Now I can only write, and that only when I get out of pain.\n",
      "He was well rid of her.\n",
      "Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann, and then could not get back to sleep.\n",
      "His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing.\n",
      "The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country, but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it.\n",
      "The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work.\n",
      "He found that if he was tired enough at night, he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake.\n",
      "He had plenty of work to do.\n",
      "The grass in the meadows came fast, now that the warm weather was here.\n",
      "He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water, so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows.\n",
      "When, in late afternoon on the last day in June, he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house, he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle.\n",
      "When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman, he was more puzzled than ever.\n",
      "Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly, staggering, as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet.\n",
      "They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him, and now he saw that both were young, not more than nineteen or twenty.\n",
      "They were dirty, their clothes were torn, and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door.\n",
      "She lay there, making no effort to get back on her feet.\n",
      "The boy came on to the porch and sat down, his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring.\n",
      "Morgan hesitated, thinking that if this was a trick, it was a good one.\n",
      "He didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending.\n",
      "Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house, he walked to the girl.\n",
      "Her blond hair was frowzy, her dress torn in several places, and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection.\n",
      "It must have hurt her even to walk, for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding.\n"

      "He fled through the door and down the steps, running, and the men grunted and followed, pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light.\n",
      "Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave.\n",
      "in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground, then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear.\n",
      "The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow.\n",
      "The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion.\n",
      "he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north.\n",
      "He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life, the men who had worked for him, sworn their loyalty to him.\n",
      "Now they were riding to kill him.\n",
      "With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his, that he would never see again.\n",
      "The Gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him.\n",
      "He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead, he was passing from life.\n",
      "Julia, seeing the bandage, rushed to him.\n",
      "He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek.\n",
      "First, we've got to get out of here''.\n",
      "Mike debated it, trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride.\n",
      "And, for the sake of Julia and Susan, it had to be tried.\n",
      "Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency.\n",
      "He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske.\n",
      "`` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride'', he said.\n",
      "All of you be ready to ride hell for leather''.\n",
      "He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.\n",
      "She clung to him, talking to him, and dabbing at her eyes.\n",
      "He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had.\n",
      "She too began to weep.\n",
      "He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself, pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her.\n",
      "And using him, Mike McLish, as a sop to her pride.\n",
      "He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.\n",
      "`` Stay well back of me'', he said.\n",
      "`` I'm going to walk up to the horses, bold as brass, pretending I'm one of the guerrillas.\n",
      "There's bound to be someone on guard, but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close''.\n",
      "Holding the pistol concealed, he walked to the rear wall of the stockade.\n",
      "`` Who's that''??\n",
      "`` Is that you, Bill''??\n",
      "But the luck that had been running their way left him.\n",
      "He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body.\n",
      "Mike, off balance, managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded.\n",
      "You'll have to try it alone''.\n",
      "Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse.\n",
      "Try to find these Feds.\n",
      "We'll still have the rifle, and I might be able to round up some more.\n",
      "Mike ran down the line, slashing picket ropes with the bayonet.\n",
      "They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar.\n",
      "Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches.\n",
      "Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings.\n",
      "A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left, but he, too, suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade.\n",
      "Mike crawled to the door and peered in.\n",
      "The orderly room seemed to be deserted.\n",
      "Ducking inside, he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner.\n",
      "Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner, spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty.\n",
      "He set his bundle down.\n",
      "Bullets began to snap past him.\n",
      "One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack.\n",
      "Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down.\n",
      "Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door.\n",
      "Mike rolled to Susan, grasped her around the knees, dragging her off her feet.\n",
      "He hovered over her to shield her, for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls.\n",
      "The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings.\n",
      "The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring.\n",
      "The roof of the command post began to buckle.\n",
      "`` Drag the wagons to the spring''!!\n",
      "The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows, giving light enough to examine Mike's wound.\n",
      "The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee, inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor.\n",
      "Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it.\n",
      "`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village''!!\n",
      "Now dammit, I don't want to go into any more explanations.\n",
      "Keep this to yourself''.\n",
      "The men seem to think so''.\n",
      "Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal.\n",
      "`` That was a terrible thing to do'', I said to Oso.\n",
      "`` Mr. Manuel did that in the war.\n",
      "That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King.\n",
      "Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid'em for their horses.\n",
      "Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up.\n",
      "He did that with all the Nations.\n",
      "I saw that letter.\n",
      "`` But that was war'', I said.\n",
      "And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land''.\n",
      "That's why the Trust don't want us to make it.\n",
      "-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work!!\n",
      "Well, talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up''!!\n",
      "As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection, I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic, especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company.\n",
      "In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses, I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river.\n",
      "`` It was a terrible thing to do.\n",
      "But Oso replied calmly, `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country, rev'rend''.\n",
      "Montero had set up a strong position, using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush.\n",
      "He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire.\n",
      "the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible.\n",
      "Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors.\n",
      "The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time, and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day.\n",
      "They poured through the opening in the valley, then spread out in a long line to come at us, brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry.\n",
      "`` That'll be a pleasure to see'', the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle.\n",
      "Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions.\n",
      "My God, how long is he going to wait, I thought.\n",
      "As he started to slump over, another warrior swung him onto his horse.\n",
      "At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony.\n",
      "He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing.\n",
      "`` If you're goin' to kill'em --!!\n",
      "A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy.\n",
      "One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek.\n",
      "The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat.\n",
      "I could see the blood running down his chest.\n",
      "He was riding between two warriors, who held him erect when he started to slump.\n",
      "I forgot to aim.\n",
      "This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically, but they held their fire.\n",
      "A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale, firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight.\n",
      "I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot, then run back to his position.\n",
      "The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again.\n",
      "Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales.\n",
      "It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors, old and young, wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam, slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses.\n",
      "Others, badly wounded, gripped hands in manes, knees in bellies, held on as long as possible and then, weak from ghastly wounds, slipped sideways, slowly, almost thoughtfully, to be broken under the slashing hoofs.\n",
      "Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded, screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts.\n",
      "She was carrying a quirt, and she started to raise it, then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist.\n",
      "`` I saw your fire'', she said, speaking slowly, making an effort to control her anger.\n",
      "`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size.\n",
      "It wouldn't matter to a fool like you.\n",
      "It would to me''.\n",
      "Let it burn down.\n",
      "It took him a long time to compose himself.\n",
      "It's bigger than it has to be, though I don't see where it's doing any harm.\n",
      "She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face.\n",
      "It didn't seem to tell her anything.\n",
      "She glanced around the clearing, taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground, the two kids, the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight.\n",
      "Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled, and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it.\n",
      "I ought to.\n",
      "`` Carwood didn't tell you that'', she said.\n",
      "It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of.\n",
      "If you want to see'' --\n",
      "`` It wouldn't matter to my father, and not to me.\n",
      "I meant what I said about that fire.\n",
      "I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now''.\n",
      "It was meant to insult him, and didn't quite succeed.\n",
      "He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly, and it was his turn to smile now.\n",
      "He meant to say more, but he never got the chance.\n",
      "She brought the quirt down, slashing it across his cheek, and he tried to step back.\n",
      "She came down against him, and he tried to break her fall.\n",
      "He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee, taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him.\n",
      "`` I ought to'' -- he said.\n",
      "`` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you, where it would do the most good.\n",
      "The fire had gone down, and the man was only a shadow against the trees.\n",
      "And he was handsome, despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek.\n",
      "`` Put the rifle down, Joseph'', the girl said.\n",
      "`` I thought I told you to stay home''.\n",
      "The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap.\n",
      "But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth, and his eyes were hurt and angry.\n",
      "`` Who was that''??\n",
      "`` He works for my father'', the girl said, and then seemed to change her mind.\n",
      "Is there anything else you want to know''??\n",
      "`` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby'', Wilson said.\n",
      "He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt, and he grabbed her wrist.\n",
      "`` I've had enough of that.\n",
      "I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business, and I don't care about that, either.\n",
      "But I'll know how to handle you next time''.\n",
      "She brought up her free hand to hit him, but this time he was quicker.\n",
      "He had forgotten that she was so pretty.\n",
      "He had known women like that, one woman in particular.\n",
      "He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees, and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer, then went up to where the children were sleeping.\n",
      "He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes, letting himself be browbeaten by a woman.\n",
      "And determined not to show it.\n",
      "They lay a little too stiffly, with their eyes straining to stay closed.\n",
      "`` Go to sleep'', he said.\n",
      "There's better things to do than listen to something like that.\n",
      "I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes, if you want me''.\n",
      "He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream.\n",
      "The coyote was calling again, and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it.\n",
      "He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble.\n",
      "Well, the grass was there, though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it.\n",
      "The water was there, so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard.\n",
      "In the last analysis, though, Wilson had little cause to complain.\n",
      "It hadn't started out that way.\n",
      "And he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better.\n",
      "They had the house cleaned up by noon, and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses.\n",
      "He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness, and finally went over to help him.\n",
      "They were going to town, and they were both excited.\n",
      "Wilson backed the team into the traces, and wished they weren't going to town at all.\n",
      "It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember.\n",
      "He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning, and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem.\n",
      "There was brush, and stands of pine that no grass could grow under, and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze.\n",
      "There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees, fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard.\n",
      "Yes, there was plenty of water, too much, and that was probably the trouble.\n",
      "A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there, watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road.\n",
      "It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville.\n",
      "Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this;;\n",
      "under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all.\n",
      "I went to the hall in the afternoons only, on these preliminary matters.\n",
      "His authority extended to the far edge of the counter, no further.\n",
      "None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him.\n",
      "He spoke to me in a gruff voice, an affectation which quite belied his personality.\n",
      "It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was.\n",
      ") hung on a hook on the wall, and underneath it I could see his tie, knotted, ready to be slipped over his head, a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck.\n",
      "Once, pressing him, I learned that his job was only part-time, in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall.\n",
      "Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person.\n",
      "In the mornings, I was informed, fluorescent tubes, similar to the one above the counter, illuminated the entire hall.\n",
      "They, and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents, down at the far end of the hall, could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office.\n",
      "He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words.\n",
      "Now, here was something of obvious importance to me, yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand.\n",
      "He couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them, he said.\n",
      "Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient.\n",
      "Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed, I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself.\n",
      "The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air.\n",
      "By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time.\n",
      "For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended.\n",
      "I could observe the two fans down at the end, but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison.\n",
      "I had for some time been hoping, in vain, for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself.\n",
      "I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall, but what they were doing, and exactly where, I could not tell.\n",
      "It was, I felt, possible that they were men who, having received no tickets for that day, had remained in the hall, to sleep perhaps, in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light.\n",
      "This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall, and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying, or squatting, on the floor below.\n",
      "Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder.\n",
      "No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me, at times quite sharply, in order to bring back my attention.\n",
      "And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place, like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office, flicked off and on impatiently.\n",
      "It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here.\n",
      "I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed.\n",
      "I felt strongly attached to the hall, however, and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance.\n",
      "I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to.\n",
      "I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing.\n",
      "Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town, its character was wholly foreign to me.\n",
      "Its front was windowless, but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows, now blinded, had once looked out upon the street.\n",
      "I kept circling the block hoping to see, from the street behind it, the rear of the hall.\n",
      "For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages, truck terminals and taxi repair shops, gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters, yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there.\n",
      "I returned to the hall, despite my dislike for the clerk.\n",
      "As I had expected, he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application.\n",
      "Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer.\n",
      "At last, when I put it to him directly, the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual.\n",
      "When I asked him what, if anything, I could do about it, he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall.\n",
      "The clerk impressed this upon me: that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock.\n",
      "Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people.\n",
      "The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men.\n",
      "The director came to the door.\n",
      "I was at once disappointed, although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained.\n",
      "they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment.\n",
      "But he came toward me sedately enough, showed me around the counter, offered me a seat inside his office, then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application.\n",
      "I had the impression that he had read my forms, perhaps several times.\n",
      "As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper, slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall.\n",
      "indeed, my scholastic qualifications were such that he, a college graduate himself, must envy me them.\n",
      "Was I sure, he asked, that I knew what I was applying for??\n",
      "I felt certain that the director, like the afternoon clerk, seldom moved beyond the counter, that the hall, to them, was a jungle, a dark and unwelcome place.\n",
      "Though I doubted that he would understand me, I told the director my motives for applying.\n",
      "This desire, I went on, growing voluble as my conviction was aroused, had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing.\n",
      "To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence.\n",
      "The flat, hard cap was small, but he thrust it to the back of his head.\n",
      "The man went over without sound, falling to the bare floor.\n",
      "Barton said harshly, `` Why did you do that''??\n",
      "`` What did you want me to do, kiss him??\n",
      "The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out.\n",
      "It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him, the thin-lipped smile held insolence, but he had no time to waste now.\n",
      "There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate, but they were in other cell blocks.\n",
      "`` I've got to have help''.\n",
      "The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet.\n",
      "The sergeant turned to the door.\n",
      "Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts.\n",
      "He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short.\n",
      "The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards, three the striped suits of convicts.\n",
      "It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison.\n",
      "Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself, shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants, the worn brown shirt.\n",
      "Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers.\n",
      "`` I won't even try to thank you''.\n",
      "We've been starving and I don't like to starve''.\n",
      "`` Meaning you want me to ride out''??\n",
      "`` I got no place to go''.\n",
      "It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses, to call them Night Riders, to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.\n",
      "But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals, men who knew how to use a gun against men, who would match the killers on the other side.\n",
      "`` Your choice'', he said briefly, and turned to Kid Boyd.\n",
      "It had drawn them together, and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape.\n",
      "A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail''.\n",
      "When they learn you're in the hills though, they'll rally, don't worry about that''.\n",
      "Dill was silent as if he hated to answer, and Barton had a cold, sick feeling of apprehension.\n",
      "Your cousin Finley saw to that.\n",
      "He sold out to Kruger's men.\n",
      "That's what they'll expect you to do.\n",
      "Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage, and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care.\n",
      "I've got to get the boy.\n",
      "Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places, carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult.\n",
      "It was over an hour before their escape was discovered, but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.\n",
      "For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg, and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.\n",
      "It was partially cemented by ages and pressure, yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams, the force of a thousand fire hoses, and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices.\n",
      "Ten years older than Mitch Barton, he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation.\n",
      "He was proud of his accomplishments, proud of his job, proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him.\n",

      "After they had finished eating, Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm -- `` so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle'' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother.\n",
      "She had offered to walk, but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` Auntie''.\n",
      "When they reached their neighbor's house, Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead, the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again.\n",
      "Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill, with the village as her ostensible destination.\n",
      "So simple, in fact, that it might even work -- although Pamela, now, in her new frame of mind, was careful not to pretend too much assurance.\n",
      "That mistake, she thought, had cost her dearly these past few days, and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her.\n",
      "She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest.\n",
      "When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house, Pamela turned the wheel, guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house, and stopped.\n",
      "All of her movements were careful and methodical, partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime.\n",
      "Here, she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.\n",
      "He had belonged to this land and, perhaps, had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him.\n",
      "She would return this symbol to the mountain, as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice.\n",
      "Slowly and thoughtfully, she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks, moved down the stairs and out of the house.\n",
      "There was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed, unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom.\n",
      "Atonement, if atonement were possible, could only be made at that sacred, sacrificial basin.\n",
      "It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation, beg forgiveness.\n",
      "But she was caught in it, and she faced the terrible possibility that, if it were a dream, it was one from which she might never awaken.\n",
      "Facing the forest now, she who had not dared to enter it before, walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool.\n",
      "She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace, and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it.\n",
      "Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun, all dewy-eyed and soft, caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time.\n",
      "No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning.\n",
      "Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed.\n",
      "Was it not possible, after all, that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this??\n",
      "The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now, and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear.\n",
      "She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought, and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated, undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants.\n",
      "Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her, Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them.\n",
      "She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail;;\n",
      "If, as she walked, her steps fumbled from time to time, she chose to ignore that omen.\n",
      "If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim, she tried not to heed.\n",
      "she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest.\n",
      "Red man or white man, pacifist or killer, the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence;;\n",
      "knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man.\n",
      "If, when this was all over, she found the words to tell him about it, she wondered if he would ever understand.\n",
      "they would not dare to face his scoffing.\n",
      "Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger, and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass, Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction.\n",
      "Nevertheless, she continued to move upward.\n",
      "She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing, and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles.\n",
      "The forest had become an alien world where she strove, alone, unprotected, unguided, to deal with whatever hindrances were offered.\n",
      "It was a bold, dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress, eclipsing the sun and human time.\n",
      "At one and the same time, she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry.\n",
      "Silence came into the forest -- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees.\n",
      "Silence walked at Pamela's side, its presence numbingly close, yet too far for her to hear.\n",
      "She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth.\n",
      "In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance, she fell, bruising her arm on a naked stone.\n",
      "For a moment, she could not catch her breath and then, her breath returning in short, frightened spasms, she lifted herself to her feet laboriously.\n",
      "She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes.\n",
      "She seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees.\n",
      "She stood quite still, trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn, a path to follow, a clue to guide her.\n",
      "The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped, virtually shutting out the sun completely.\n",
      "She had the feeling that, under the mouldering leaves, there would be the bodies of dead animals, quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain.\n",
      "Not a breeze exactly, but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove, catching Pamela in a leering embrace.\n",
      "There was a peculiar density about it, a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified, never actually perceived.\n",
      "She already knew this unwholesome, chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive.\n",
      "It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body, seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin.\n",
      "It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus, and its particles, spreading, creeping, crawling, joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached;;\n",
      "stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps;;\n",
      "clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws.\n",
      "She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain, depriving her of reason and sight.\n",
      "But she did not know which way to go.\n",
      "She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles.\n",
      "She had to escape.\n",
      "She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place.\n",
      "She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back.\n",
      "She began it deliberately, so that none of her words would be lost on him.\n",
      "`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord.\n",
      "I'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg, and that I don't amount to anything.\n",

      "I've got something to say to you, and by God you're going to listen.\n",
      "You're going to listen''!!\n",
      "He said he wanted very much to listen.\n",
      "He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important, as well as pleasin' to the ear, and he didn't want to miss a word of it.\n",
      "He waited at the car side for a moment, looking down at her expectantly.\n",
      "Wasn't you goin' to say somethin'''??\n",
      "Then, helpfully, as she merely stared at him in weary silence, `` Maybe you could write it down for me, huh??\n",
      "He grinned, nodded, and walked around to the front of the car.\n",
      "Lips pursed mournfully, he stared down at its crazily sagging left side.\n",
      "Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots, peered into the orderly chaos of axle, shock absorber, and spring.\n",
      "He went prone on his stomach, the better to pursue his examination.\n",
      "Never, he'd once told Joyce, had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun.\n",
      "And he really feels that way, she thought.\n",
      "against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis.\n",
      "He could move very quickly, she knew( although he seldom found occasion to do so), but he was more wiry than truly strong.\n",
      "Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone.\n",
      "But, by gosh, I want him and I'm going to have him!!\n",
      "He slid in at her side, tucked a cigar into his mouth, and politely proffered one to her.\n",
      "`` Can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute''??\n",
      "`` I feel like getting back to town, that's what I feel like!!\n",
      "Now, are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk''??\n",
      "`` Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes, so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me''.\n",
      "`` See that wildcat''??\n",
      "She saw it then, the distant derrick of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country.\n",
      "And even with her limited knowledge of such things, she knew that the car could be repaired there;;\n",
      "sufficiently, at least, to get them back into town.\n",
      "A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency.\n",
      "He had to depend on himself, since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.\n",
      "`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag??\n",
      "Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you''??\n",
      "In his mood, it was the best way to handle him;;\n",
      "that is, to show no curiosity whatsoever.\n",
      "It poured out of him like an electric current, a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action, and that that action would be all that he anticipated.\n",
      "That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride, field boss for the Highlands Oil& Gas Company.\n",
      "Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time, just waiting to catch him out of line.\n",
      "It was the wrong thing to say.\n",
      "By failing to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into Lord's hands.\n",
      "The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest.\n",
      "The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him.\n",
      "`` Well, I'll tell you about that'', Lord told him.\n",
      "Don't like to bother no one unless we have to, which I figger we do, in your case.\n",
      "Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots''.\n",
      "He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company, but that had nothing to do with him.\n",
      "He was an honest man doing a hard job, and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.\n",
      "You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped'em do it.\n",
      "An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks.\n",
      "So you get rid of that pistol right now, Mis-ter McBride.\n",
      "You do that or take you out a permit right now''.\n",
      "How could he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line, as he had to -- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown??\n",
      "`` I'll get around to it a little later'', he mumbled desperately.\n",
      "`` Just as soon as I go to the bank, and'' --\n",
      "It was strictly the deputy's game, but McBride had gone too far to throw in.\n",
      "He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him, inadvertently shoving him into a storefront.\n",
      "It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition.\n",
      "Lord slugged him in the stomach, so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine.\n",
      "And then there was a numbing blow to the heart, and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach\n",
      "He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen.\n",
      "Why, he's going to kill me, he thought wildly.\n",
      "I've given willful hurt to no man.\n",
      "I was just doing my job, just following orders, and for that he's going to kill me.\n",
      "Beat me to death in front of a hundred people.\n",
      "Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it: the murder would go unpunished.\n",
      "Fear-maddened, fleeing the lengthening shadow of death, he scrambled to his feet again.\n",
      "He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago, and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air.\n",
      "He hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world.\n",
      "laughing at a dying man, laughing as a man was beaten to death.\n",
      "Donna, his young wife, the girl who was both daughter and wife to him.\n",
      "The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground.\n",
      "There was some idle talk, a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive.\n",
      "But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit.\n",
      "Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena, trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing.\n",
      "Conchita nagged at the younger children, attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon.\n",
      "She wished that she could talk to her mother about it.\n",
      "Not that her mother knew what had happened, but they could speculate upon it.\n",
      "But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it, and say that it was none of her concern.\n",
      "`` Pat, get out of that creek!!\n",
      "Even as she called to the children, Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon.\n",
      "It bothered her that she probably would never know.\n",
      "He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs -- as though she were a little kid like Elena!!\n",
      "Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel, with the other two facing him.\n",
      "He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do.\n",
      "They were considering it gravely, neither seeming to like what he planned.\n",
      "Give her time to miss you.\n",
      "Maybe she will then come to you.\n",
      "`` John Clayton will see to that''.\n",
      "`` In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me'', Brannon said flatly.\n",
      "I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether.\n",
      "`` But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good''.\n",
      "`` That I can't answer, for I can't imagine something like this happening to me.\n",
      "Like Luis, I can't see something like this happening to me.\n",
      "You're going to need your woman.\n",
      "`` I won't force Beth to come against her will.\n",
      "But I'm going to have my son''.\n",
      "Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall.\n",
      "During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east.\n",
      "There were seven of them, enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff.\n",
      "It was to be nothing more than that.\n",
      "There was to be no gunplay.\n",
      "He didn't want to put himself outside the law.\n",
      "A lamp burned inside, but Brannon, peering through the window, saw that the office was empty.\n",
      "He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there.\n",
      "`` Maybe to have supper.\n",
      "With Red Hogan, he rode to the Welcome Cafe.\n",
      "Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside.\n",
      "They rode to the Rockfork House, a little farther along the opposite side of the street.\n",
      "They reined in there, Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room.\n",
      "It seemed long, at least to Tom Brannon.\n",
      "He and Hogan waited by the door, one to either side.\n",
      "Macklin was the third man to come out, and he came unhurriedly.\n",
      "It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them, and then it was too late.\n",
      "They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office.\n",
      "`` Now, hold on, damn it;;\n",
      "Brannon said, `` Now the key to the lockup, Marshal''.\n",
      "`` We're putting you where you won't come to harm.\n",
      "His face took on a sudden pallor, became beaded with sweat, and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing.\n",
      "Resignedly, Macklin turned to the back door.\n",
      "They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear.\n",
      "Macklin balked again, not wanting to unlock and open the door.\n",
      "They crowded him in that threatening way once more, forced him to give in.\n",
      "They returned to the street, mounted their horses, rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street.\n",
      "He came to the edge of the veranda, peered down at them with his hand on his gun.\n",
      "`` Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you''.\n",
      "Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering.\n",
      "They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor, four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house.\n",
      "They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves, that of their own sweat, of campfire smoke, of horses and cattle.\n",
      "Their presence fouled the elegance of that room.\n",
      "The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing.\n",
      "For, with a single exception, nothing had happened to them.\n",
      "After walking out to his corral that morning, he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet.\n",
      "There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near.\n",
      "He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread.\n",
      "William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again, that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet, and once more he accused and threatened everyone.\n",
      "He found nothing, but he still refused to give up and move out.\n",
      "`` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face''!!\n",
      "He never got that chance.\n",
      "He slumped against a log fence rail, then tried to lift himself.\n",
      "An inquest was held, and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes, the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards.\n",
      "Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then, and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway, the prosecuting attorney, a Colonel Baird, ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning.\n",
      "It took some time to locate Horn.\n",
      "But that indictment was never made.\n",
      "For Tom Horn, it turned out, had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing.\n",
      "The authorities had to release him.\n",
      "He immediately rode on to Cheyenne, threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends.\n",
      "`` Dead center at three hundred yards, that coroner said''!!\n",
      "`` Three shots in that fella'fore he hit the ground!!\n",
      "You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that''??\n",
      "For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do.\n",
      "A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats.\n",
      "For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on -- a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell.\n",
      "Haying time was close at hand, and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack.\n",
      "Harnessing a team to a buckboard, they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off, then climbed down and began chopping.\n",
      "He looked around in surprise, then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest.\n",
      "The hired man ran over to help his boss.\n",
      "But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies, and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing.\n",
      "A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place.\n",
      "Later, riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne, he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made.\n",
      "Even as he became widely known as a professional killer, nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend.\n",
      "`` Yeah, I can see that'', the friend was forced to agree.\n",
      "`` But well, it just don't seem sportin' somehow''!!\n",
      "I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill, and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught, tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls.\n",
      "I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink'em and squeeze him to death.\n",
      "This was the message found tacked to the cabin door.\n",
      "No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer.\n",
      "Jury, judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere, at any time, to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated.\n",
      "It is possible, although highly doubtful, that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state.\n",
      "It is also possible, but equally doubtful, that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him.\n",
      "For that legend was growing explosively, Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man.\n",
      "( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125, very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found.\n",
      "( A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest.\n",
      "One thing was certain -- his method was effective, so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary.\n",
      "The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week.\n",
      "He evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end.\n",
      "He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders.\n",
      "But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier, he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure.\n",
      "The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range, waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life.\n",
      "By 1898, rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming.\n",
      "`` What is it you want me to do, Mr. Brenner''??\n",
      "I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari.\n",
      "Tell her to come here to the hotel''.\n",
      "`` You're not to mention my name.\n",
      "Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her''.\n",
      "`` I don't know, Mr. Brenner'', he said haltingly, beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans.\n",
      "`` It doesn't seem quite right, telling her a thing like that.\n",
      "Brenner continued to smile, but his eyes were cold.\n",
      "`` Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company.\n",
      "If someone were to drop a match in here, this place would go up like a haystack''.\n",
      "He started toward the stairway, then turned to add, `` Tell her to come to Adams's room, that Adams is in trouble.\n",
      "Tell her to hurry''.\n",
      "Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching.\n",
      "He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right, then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.\n",
      "The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret it this way.\n",
      "A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed.\n",
      "Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding.\n",
      "From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street.\n",
      "He moved ahead carefully, his left hand in front of him, and came to a wooden partition.\n",
      "It was certain now that Jess was in the house, but also, presumably, was Stacey Black.\n",
      "Curt wanted to get Jess alone, without interference from anyone, even as spineless a person as the store owner.\n",
      "The horse continued to snort.\n",
      "Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice.\n",
      "A match flared, and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop.\n",
      "As he crossed to the side of the stall, Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.\n",
      "`` Remember what happened to Gruller''.\n",
      "He started to reach for his gun, but apparently thought better of it.\n",
      "`` Just hold it that way''.\n",
      "He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt.\n",
      "`` You and I have a little talking to do, Jess.\n",
      "`` Damn you, Adams'' -- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock.\n",
      "`` We ain't got nothing to talk about.\n",
      "If I don't come back in the house, Breed's going to'' --\n",
      "I don't know what you're up to, but when Brenner'' --\n",
      "`` It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about''.\n",
      "`` So help me, Crouch, I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, before I do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him.\n",
      "Who told you to do it??\n",
      "He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face, but didn't finish the motion.\n",
      "Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess, but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it.\n",
      "Apparently sensing this, and realizing that it gave him an advantage, Jess became bold.\n",
      "Curt, angry enough to be a little reckless, raised his hands shoulder high.\n",
      "I just wanted to hear you say so''.\n",
      "Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides.\n",
      "He had found Curt's weakness, or what to Jess was a weakness, and was smart enough to take advantage of it.\n",
      "Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention.\n",
      "He had to make Jess talk, and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate.\n",
      "Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist, and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section.\n",
      "Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder, but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit.\n",
      "As it was, his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move.\n",
      "When his eyes began to focus, he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork.\n",
      "Curt twisted to one side, and the tines of the fork bit into the floor.\n",
      "Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose.\n",
      "It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet.\n",
      "The tines broke off under Jess's twisting, and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out.\n",
      "He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly, putting everything he had behind them.\n",
      "When his head came down, Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall.\n",
      "The building shook, setting the lantern to swaying, and the buckskin to pitching again.\n",
      "Even Black's old crowbait began to snort, and from the house Black yelled, `` Jess!!\n",
      "He lurched drunkenly to his feet, lowered his head, and took one step away from the wall.\n",
      "Blood gushed from his nose, and he backed off as rapidly as he could, stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists.\n",
      "He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble''.\n",
      "He let go of the shirt, and Jess slumped to the floor.\n",
      "Turning his back, Curt crossed to the stall, reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope, and waved his hand in the animal's face.\n",
      "Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door.\n",
      "I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else''.\n",
      "Curt followed, reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it.\n",
      "`` We're going to Marshal Woods's house.\n",
      "`` Soon as we send them on their way and make camp, let's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves''.\n",
      "`` Sally'', admonished her mother, `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan.\n",
      "Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting.\n",
      "`` Got a lot to tend to, but I'll get back quick as I can'', he assured her.\n",
      "Soon as the Burnsides moved on, he'd lead Rex down by the river;;\n",
      "If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did, my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!!\n",
      "From the way the wound in his head was itching, Dan knew that it would heal.\n",
      "The Burnsides, now ready to roll, were purposefully deaf to his cry.\n",
      "He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him.\n",
      "`` I ain't going to fight you no more''.\n",
      "Nate turned his head, attempting to speak in a soothing voice.\n",
      "`` Here's a present for you'', he said, shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead.\n",
      "`` Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by''!!\n",
      "Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan.\n",
      "Much as they had to look forward to, they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go.\n",
      "She had spent too many hours looking ahead, hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness.\n",
      "Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that, for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them, Matilda could not speak at all.\n",
      "Then, with a glory that almost wiped out the deep, downward sags in her careworn face, Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez, who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa!!\n",
      "Hez asked, who still believed they'd have them to lick.\n",
      "Soon they were all shouting greetings, exchanging smiles, and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again.\n",
      "Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle, tended the cattle, tethered the horses, gathered fuel, carried water, and started their cooking fires.\n",
      "Then, and only then, with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor, did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news.\n",
      "The wound in his scalp was examined, pronounced healing, and well doctored with simples, before they dished up the victuals.\n",
      "From then on, in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood, the whole group settled down to relish their food.\n",
      "Only, they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration.\n",
      "`` Golly'', Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators, `` don't that fiddle make you wish the Bible didn't say us Baptists can't dance''??\n",
      "`` Not that it matters to me, being this far along''.\n",
      "Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply, `` I ain't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell, but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles''.\n",
      "He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers.\n",
      "With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff, Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box, to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs, and worried about all that might have happened to Sally.\n",
      "And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now, out there in the midst of a gay, youthful circle, skipping and singing, `` Farmer in the dell, Farmer in the dell, Heigh-ho the dairy-oh, the farmer in the dell''.\n",
      "She was glad, completely and unselfishly glad, to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan.\n",
      "And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod.\n",
      "Out in the center of the circle the farmer, who was Dan, wasted no time when they came to the line, `` The farmer choose his wife''.\n",
      "With a swift swoop of his big arms, he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him, and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit''.\n",
      "By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting, or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them.\n",
      "No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey, each one exerted its own appeal.\n",
      "Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness.\n",
      "Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them.\n",
      "Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy, as a mother always does when a marriage is made, did not prevent her from having the first carefree, dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley, way, way back there when they were crossing those other mountains.\n"

      "Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero.\n",
      "Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually, even were he to prove the thief.\n",
      "The Palace was an elaborate establishment, built practically on stilts in front, with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch.\n",
      "Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside.\n",
      "Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch.\n",
      "The front windows of the place were long and narrow, reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior.\n",
      "Nerves tight as a bowstring, he paused to gather his wits.\n",
      "Against all expectation, Carmer was inside, clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him.\n",
      "He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot.\n",
      "Muffling an exclamation, Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down.\n",

      "Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside.\n",

      "Giving the other a dark look, he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street.\n",
      "At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner, and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler.\n",
      "`` Penny's always glad to see me over there'', he mused bleakly.\n",
      "Over and above that, however, was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events.\n",
      "`` It's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money.\n",
      "How much of an accident could that be''??\n",
      "Nearing home, he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun.\n",
      "In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot;;\n",
      "Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter, with growing alarm.\n",
      "Still a quarter-mile away, the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed.\n",
      "Setting a course straight for the house, he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face.\n",
      "Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and, having spotted his approach, was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight.\n",
      "If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested, he had his answer a moment later.\n",
      "A harsh cry floated to him across the brush.\n",
      "Leading his pony, he hurried that way, not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range.\n",
      "Swinging up then, and bending forward over the horn, he urged his mount down the meandering draw.\n",
      "At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw.\n",
      "Sweeping a look around, he saw that he was safe for the moment.\n",
      "Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions.\n",
      "Every plane that could fly was sent into the air.\n",
      "Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan.\n",
      "Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area, with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships.\n",
      "Greg himself took two flights, with Todman leading the second, to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte.\n",
      "A weapons carrier took Greg, Todman, Belton, Banjo Ferguson, and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip.\n",
      "No one had much to say.\n",
      "The sky glowered down at them.\n",
      "There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever.\n",
      "Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it.\n",
      "The expression was his trade-mark, his open sesame to good luck, and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return.\n",
      "From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight, he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip.\n",
      "He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission.\n",
      "Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip, and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him.\n",
      "The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission, and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan.\n",
      "Greg's mission was the last to leave, and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again.\n",
      "He possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying, and he wondered, if the ceiling did drop, whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory.\n",
      "As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it.\n",
      "They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned.\n",
      "`` Todman, let's try to go under this stuff.\n",
      "Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf.\n",
      "He dropped down to five hundred feet, swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban, and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain.\n",
      "The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet, and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in.\n",
      "He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast.\n",
      "Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him.\n",
      "`` Somebody beat us to it''!!\n",
      "Visibility continued to be limited, and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet.\n",
      "He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill.\n",
      "Finally, as time began to run out, he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies.\n",
      "There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run.\n",
      "Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home.\n",
      "He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in: `` Sweeneys!!\n",
      "And only a few seconds to answer it.\n",
      "He narrowed the shape down to two: either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft.\n",
      "His present maximum altitude, up against the overcast, gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages.\n",
      "But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy, if it was the enemy, and he hadn't been spotted already.\n",
      "The opposing aircraft continued to come on.\n",
      "They appeared to be the enemy.\n",
      "Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes.\n",
      "There was, of course, no way for the other planes to get by them.\n",
      "But they could turn and escape to the east.\n",
      "Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight.\n",
      "`` Greg to Sweeney Blue.\n",
      "It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery.\n",
      "Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM, and the engine responded as if it had been waiting.\n",
      "`` They haven't seen us'', Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise.\n",
      "It was going to be dangerous.\n",
      "It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted.\n",
      "It was all Greg had time to see.\n",
      "He had no idea which was up and which was down.\n",
      "`` Moriarty'', my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite, so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity, mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced.\n",
      "We were coming to an intersection, turning right, chuffing to a stop.\n",
      "Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican: Moriarty, New Mexico.\n",
      "I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass.\n",
      "Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible, near, or enviably near that spot where -- hidden -- more delicately-textured, most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool, oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes.\n",
      "Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching, its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me.\n",
      "The voice was that of Johnson, tail gunner off another crew.\n",
      "I said that it didn't make any difference to me either, as far as I knew.\n",
      "Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit''( 35 m.p.h.) `` is still in ee-faket''.\n",
      "I let up on the accelerator, only to gradually reach again the 60 m.p.h. which would, I hoped, overhaul Herry and the blonde, and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I, Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe.\n",
      "Mrs. Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son, who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs''.\n",
      "Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age.\n",
      "Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet'', but her Herman was getting to be a man, there was no getting around it.\n",
      "Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would, she said, lead us to Taos and then Raton and `` eventshahleh'' out of New Mexico.\n",
      "Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck, father or grandfather of Senor `` Moriarty's'' Ford sedan, came screeching to a dust-swirling stop, and a brown face appeared, its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window.\n",
      "`` In back, buddy'', the driver said to me.\n",
      "it flopped down, sprang back up and gouged my shin.\n",
      "I seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time, one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag -- and merely wrecking my camera, I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report.\n",
      "I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle.\n",
      "Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all.\n",
      "Whatever satisfaction that might offer.\n",
      "The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke, but, no, he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear.\n",
      "At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish, but -- the driver's white teeth flashing at me, the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair, beyond his gesticulating bottle -- it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing;;\n",
      "Johnson was trying to grab the wheel, though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it.\n",
      "I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards.\n",
      "Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down.\n",
      "Just as I got to my knees, there was again the sound of the fence stretching, and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously.\n",
      "The car was just about to us, its driver's fat, solemn face intent on the road ahead, on business, on a family in Sante Fe -- on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue.\n",
      "The Indian was again raising his bottle, but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips.\n",
      "There was no time to pick out a penny;;\n",
      "Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number.\n",
      "Johnson's fat hand, another bottle were protruding from the truck cab, and that self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler, had a bottle at his own lips.\n",
      "I quickly turned around and began to drink.\n",
      "I guided her to the divan, turned off the TV, faced her.\n",
      "Eyes like hot honey, eyes that sizzled.\n",
      "Plus flawless skin, smooth brow and cheeks, lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them.\n",
      "`` No, I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here, and when it happened all I could think of was'' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself.\n",
      "She stood up, pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off, then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched, wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out.\n",
      "In fact, I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell.\n",
      "In a waterfall and all that''.\n",
      "I don't mean to pry, but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles??\n",
      "`` I really do have something important to tell you, Mr. Scott.\n",
      "They'd peddled the soap virtually alone, and without much success, until about a year ago, when -- with the addition of `` SX-21'' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit.\n",
      "The finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds, then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather, and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap;;\n",
      "even to clean men and boys.\n",
      "Joyce went on, `` When we'd finished, Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer.\n",
      "But I'm pleased to hear'' --\n",
      "I swam like mad, got out of the pool, grabbed my robe, and ran to the car.\n",
      "The keys were still in it, and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed''.\n",
      "She'd driven around for a while, Joyce said, then, thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time, she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive, parked in front, and walked toward the pool.\n",
      "There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive.\n",
      "I was so scared well, I just ran to my car and came here''.\n",
      "I didn't get a good look at him at all, his back was to me, and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit.\n",
      "What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do'', and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification.\n",
      "She realized I'd have to notify the police, but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name.\n",
      "Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series, Underwater Western Eye, a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits.\n",
      "But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal, the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife, Mrs. Oatnut Grits.\n",
      "Or at least not to Joyce.\n",
      "`` The commercials have just been for money, there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them, but in Underwater Western Eye I'd have a chance to act.\n",
      "`` I'm starting to itch'', she said.\n",
      "`` Yes, I'm still all covered with that soap.\n",
      "I was loaded with suds when I ran away, and I haven't had a chance to wash it off.\n",
      "`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone, so you can use my shower if you'd like''.\n",
      "`` Oh, I'd love to''.\n",
      "So you'll have everything all to yourself, doggone''\n",
      "Time to go, I supposed.\n",
      "`` Oh, you can count on that''.\n",
      "But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them.\n",
      "However, when there's a job to be done, I'm a monstrosity of grim determination, I like to think.\n",
      "I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door.\n",
      "Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan, and it took me less than five minutes to get there.\n",
      "I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool.\n",
      "Two uniformed officers, a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew, and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left.\n",
      "A few yards beyond the group of men, a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra.\n",
      "A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M., and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now.\n",
      "Present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man, who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been Thor's partner Bill Blake, and Antony Rose, an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account.\n",
      "`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap, a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff''.\n",
      "That was the new advertising angle -- something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient.\n",
      "`` According to Rose, he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water, got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out.\n",
      "Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living;;\n",
      "this is not so, for education offers all kinds of dividends, including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife.\n",
      "If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do, and now I understand why they are classics;;\n",
      "The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day.\n",
      "The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting.\n",
      "I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college, partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there.\n",
      "When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted.\n",
      "The arrangement turned out to be excellent.\n",
      "It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes, cover their faces with masks and go adventuring.\n",
      "One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt.\n",
      "There was something about the contour of her face, her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine, the way she held her head, the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me.\n",
      "Her legs were the full, sexy kind, full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite;;\n",
      "You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist, accustomed to studying the physical body.\n",
      "And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store.\n",
      "I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them.\n",
      "I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks.\n",
      "True, she was my Aunt, married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage, but why she had married a man twice her age, and more, perhaps, I did not know or much care.\n",
      "She was standing with her back to the glass door.\n",
      "Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body, a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired.\n",
      "Something clicked in this instance, but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it, for we both kept our distance.\n",
      "When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it.\n",
      "And then I became aware that she, too, glanced at me surreptitiously.\n",
      "I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model.\n",
      "I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship.\n",
      "I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me.\n",
      "He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly, while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living.\n",
      "Perhaps, with my Uncle, she found a measure of economic security that she needed;;\n",
      "or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father;;\n",
      "Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks, and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights.\n",
      "The cavernous depth, cluttered with antiques, echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk.\n",
      "She placed her palms, fingers outspread, on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say, `` Now, what next''??\n",
      "I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune.\n",
      "There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour.\n",
      "It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch.\n",
      "I was thinking about that.\n",
      "Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable.\n",
      "`` What are you trying to do??\n",
      "If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew''??\n",
      "`` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will.\n",
      "`` When I was in college'', I grinned, `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class.\n",
      "In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell;;\n",
      "and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us.\n",
      "If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did, so instead of just telling him I made a pass, say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am.\n",
      "And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead.\n",
      "When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it''.\n",
      "`` Are you trying to cut your throat''??\n",
      "`` No'', I chuckled, `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education''.\n",
      "I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be, but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife.\n",
      "I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date.\n",
      "Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view.\n",
      "A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner.\n",
      "I must say the figure was well made up.\n",
      "If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him.\n",
      "He had better write a postcard to Walter.\n",
      "He opened the myth book again and there( along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips) were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address.\n",
      "The code, which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest, Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use.\n",
      "A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith, and that might be good for something.\n",
      "That ought to draw a laugh, Nicolas reasoned, as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind.\n",
      "And indeed, his postcard did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend, the poet Nicolas Manas, to his friend Meredith Wilder.\n",
      "He had returned to the pension a week ago.\n",
      "He was determined to spend an industrious summer.\n",
      "And he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas.\n",
      "But Nicolas, too, was being interrupted, that morning.\n",
      "Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep;;\n",
      "She was just not able to break the spell.\n",
      "( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars??\n",
      "Nicolas: `` Look, Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex, see??\n",
      "So if all these beers was to get me in bed, man, you just spent a lot of money''.\n",
      "And when you get off this job tonight, well, you can gimme something to eat''.\n",
      "And, as a matter of fact, Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night, when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew.\n"

      "At a nod from Songau, four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms.\n",
      "but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived.\n",
      "My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face\n",
      "In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases.\n",
      "Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive, I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women.\n",
      "From L'Turu, I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes, and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations.\n",
      "Miraculously, Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes, after considerable loss of life on both sides.\n",
      "Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist.\n",
      "She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied, by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death.\n",
      "`` Karipo was great goddess, told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children'', the crone told me.\n",
      "Those who stayed had to pass tests.\n",
      "The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood.\n",
      "Maybe to beat up on his squaw''.\n",
      "Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib.\n",
      "Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack.\n",
      "`` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand, the liquor or automobiles''.\n",
      "Anyway, he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at.\n",
      "He said to his partner.\n",
      "Ramey smiled but he thought to himself, I always see me too.\n",
      "Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think.\n",
      "With this realization, sometimes, he saw himself as he looked down.\n",
      "Benson said, referring to the Indian.\n",
      "`` If you want to see something, he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car''.\n",
      "`` Too long a waiting line'', Ramey answered, pretending to joke.\n",
      "It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed.\n",
      "Horsely, an agent on the east end, wore the hat, trying to look like a tourist.\n",
      "It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist, an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head.\n",
      "The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town.\n",
      "Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear.\n",
      "When they were ready to leave, Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer.\n",
      "She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates, although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that.\n",
      "The truck routes, the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay.\n",
      "She began to watch a blonde-haired man, also in shorts, standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly.\n",
      "What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself, so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see, but Benson knew what it was.\n",
      "The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson, in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real, said, `` You don't want to go around there, Ma'am''.\n",
      "The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her.\n",
      "The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car.\n",
      "Benson said to Ramey.\n",
      "With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember.\n",
      "It was simply a matter of curiosity, a natural right to examine.\n",
      "The man said, backing up a step, still looking down.\n",
      "His words were mostly to himself.\n",
      "Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded, blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement.\n",
      "The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg.\n",
      "He stared at the shining, shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees, `` Don't do that, fella.\n",
      "The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again, with his fist.\n",
      "Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth.\n",
      "The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement.\n",
      "As he watched the man sit suddenly, a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was, really, to knock a man off his feet.\n",
      "After what seemed several seconds, the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it.\n",
      "Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him.\n",
      "The man on the ground began to move;;\n",
      "Blood dripped down the front of his sweater, soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder, as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted, running a darker color.\n",
      "`` Can you hear, can you talk to me''??\n",
      "None of the crowd had stepped forward to help.\n",
      "A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again.\n",
      "No one seemed to know for sure what had happened, nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver, beyond finding out.\n",
      "Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman.\n",
      "It's all over now, the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them.\n",
      "He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body, the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol.\n",
      "The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis.\n",
      "He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him.\n",
      "`` Mough -- it's my mough'', the man said, trying to talk without moving his lips.\n",
      "The body continued to lash, but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome, bloody mass out of the bungalow.\n",
      "It was only then that he turned to look at Penny.\n",
      "I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life, but I am.\n",
      "And for the hundredth time that week, he was startled at her beauty.\n",
      "He knew her mind pretty well, by now, its quick perceptions and sympathies, its painful insistence on truth and directness, its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate, even in part.\n",
      "`` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it, Penny'', said Keith.\n",
      "`` But knowing you, I know that you're glad to be alive, and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake, even though I had to.\n",
      "Isn't that so''??\n",
      "`` Yes'', she said, almost in a whisper, as if admitting to a crime.\n",
      "Asked Keith, his voice getting harsher in spite of himself, as he struggled to control his growing anger.\n",
      "`` It was a king cobra, the largest you ever saw, and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle, didn't it??\n",
      "`` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle.\n",
      "And you love Ahmiri, that black bastard of a servant even a little more, because he's a beautiful man.\n",
      "All of us, that is, except me.\n",
      "You hate me, you hate my guts, because I like to hunt.\n",
      "You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake.\n",
      "Penny would not rise to his mood.\n",
      "`` There isn't anything left to say, is there, Keith''??\n",
      "Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him.\n",
      "The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world, the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet.\n",
      "For a brief period each year, the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls, and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon, and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long, meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga, then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam, past the Khasi Hills, and into Bengal, past Sirinjani and Madaripur, until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal.\n",
      "Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember, during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world, thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space.\n",
      "But Keith looked down more than up.\n",
      "He thought of the jungles below him, and of the wild, strange, untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return, on foot perhaps, to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted, and animals the lords.\n",
      "Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes, to their men or to themselves.\n",
      "And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically, who might even survive.\n",
      "He knew how to shoot down Nazis.\n",
      "And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back, saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear.\n",
      "The other half he didn't like to recognize, even to himself.\n",
      "The Nazis bombed Britain, so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down.\n",
      "It was a war of nerves, of stamina, of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis, who were better organized and technically superior.\n",
      "Keith learned too much about air combat, and air killing, to be risked.\n",
      "They grounded him( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly) and put him in the Command offices.\n",
      "He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC, a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work,( regardless of how important she might have thought she was) in the Command offices, but that was all.\n",
      "He was on the thin side, with big hands, and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep.\n",
      "His hair was black, already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom, the only one permitted to a man.\n",
      "The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny, hating the cliche, had to admit that in this case it applied.\n",
      "But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly.\n",
      "The Command offices were in the border country, up north, where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports, and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy.\n",
      "The Command post was underground, and well camouflaged.\n",
      "But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps.\n",
      "There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling, but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer, if as efficacious, when a direct hit comes along.\n",
      "There was a shattering, cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle, the air filled with dust and flying debris, and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks, as ordered.\n"

      "And, as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded, and mark the several killed, he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his.\n",
      "After the war, Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her.\n",
      "She came from Ohio, from what she called a `` small farm'' of two hundred acres, as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers.\n",
      "But to Keith's London-bred mind, such acreage sounded rather invincible.\n",
      "It wasn't that, however, which decided them not to go to America.\n",
      "Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma.\n",
      "He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself.\n",
      "The terrible power of a gun, the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body, man or beast, was one he never wanted to lose.\n",
      "And in the hunting land, this hunger was considered to be a noble thing.\n",
      "When they got to Shillong, in Assam, he was happy.\n",
      "The sambur buck, the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk.\n",
      "Now, the next morning, they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms, with the weighted line beside it;;\n",
      "and Robinson Roy, who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive, was already back on the surface.\n",
      "He and his safety man, Herr Schaffner, swam up to the boarding ladder together.\n",
      "The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first.\n",
      "Robinson clambered heavily into the boat, sat down, and stripped off his triple-tank assembly.\n",
      "`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down.\n",
      "He was a huge young man of twenty-four, clothed in muscle, immensely strong, with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation.\n",
      "`` I was down to 275.\n",
      "I've been that far half a dozen times.\n",
      "And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself.\n",
      "`` No, it wasn't that'', Rob said.\n",
      "`` When I came up, damnit, I thought I was going down.\n",
      "But when it happens to you like that, I tell you, and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well, it makes you think.\n",
      "You don't head back down again.\n",
      "He had his voice under control again: no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him.\n",
      "Now he was going to show how much he knew.\n",
      "`` Well, that's the only way to be'', Mrs. Forsythe said, and gave her brassy laugh.\n",
      "`` It's nothing to fool with.\n",
      "I'm going down again''.\n",
      "`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that''.\n",
      "He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore'' was never used without irony.\n",
      "Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again: Rob was his boy, the kid he had rescued from the streets, the object of his pride.\n",
      "He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters;;\n",
      "Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge.\n",
      "Waddell had looked the man over, trying to size him up.\n",
      "He was in his early forties, rather short and very compactly built, and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways.\n",
      "His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence, until one looked into his eyes, which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence.\n",
      "Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps, and he said to himself: I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night.\n",
      "I like that kid''.\n",
      "`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country, is that right''??\n",
      "Waddell turned to face him.\n",
      "Now I wish to enter the American market, where the competition is very strong.\n",
      "I must have a powerful representative here, a firm with a national distribution and ten, twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products.\n",
      "With all respect to a fine young man, Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries''.\n",
      "We spoke of the need for advertising, and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity.\n",
      "He was most eager to make the dive;;\n",
      "`` Well, damn'', Waddell said.\n",
      "`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy''??\n",
      "Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive.\n",
      "There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said.\n",
      "All tourists come to Florida.\n",
      "This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop.\n",
      "But there is no use causing him to worry at this time''.\n",
      "It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this.\n",
      "`` By God'', Waddell said, `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times.\n",
      "Now, in that same cabin, Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk.\n",
      "He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper.\n",
      "`` Blessed Saint Nicholas, I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered.\n",
      "Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck, he took his appeal direct to Headquarters.\n",
      "As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie, who came in and sat down on a bunk.\n",
      "Anyway, I wasn't down long enough to matter.\n",
      "`` I don't think you should go down again''.\n",
      "Early that day Matsuo saw a marine.\n",
      "As his feet slowed, he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand.\n",
      "For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time.\n",
      "His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure.\n",
      "He murmured to himself, with firmness: `` No surrender''.\n",
      "It was best to die fighting the marines.\n",
      "Whichever the way, he would rot in this vast choking green, his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes.\n",
      "The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed, as though debating whether to brave the sunlight.\n",
      "They had fought from caves, and the marines resorted to burning them out.\n",
      "A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo, his friend, and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance, then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet, his uniform blazing.\n",
      "When he sank on his knees, they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy.\n",
      "Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea.\n",
      "At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle, reeking of death.\n",
      "Apprehensively he peered to the left, to the right into the leafy, vine-crisscrossed maze.\n",
      "He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow, with the one left to distract him.\n",
      "While his comrades cocked the trap, that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver.\n",
      "Taking aim at the man's face, Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge, and then he changed his mind.\n",
      "He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear, and so he aimed above the head.\n",
      "How stupid to give his position away.\n",
      "Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy, and insects hummed and birds occasionally called.\n",
      "Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness, concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke.\n",
      "When he got closer to the tree, Matsuo noted the wild look on his face.\n",
      "In the hush that followed the echoes, Matsuo was tense.\n",
      "The marine was alone, for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree.\n",
      "Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips.\n",
      "Not only had he no canteen, but he lacked even the belt to hang one on.\n",
      "`` You came well equipped to die''.\n",
      "So that had been his difficulty.\n",
      "The marine tried to roll on his right side, and moaned.\n",
      "Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle.\n",
      "He must have saturated himself in the drink, for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze.\n",
      "Even the bone handle scorched, and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it.\n",
      "A shrill yelp, kicked legs, and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist.\n",
      "The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment.\n",
      "His superiors had said that all marines were depraved.\n",
      "He began to uncap the bottle, the rusty cap squealing on its threads.\n",
      "down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out.\n",
      "The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack.\n",
      "And when this was gone, he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.\n",
      "After all, he had less reason to desire it than the marine.\n",
      "Before much longer the marine quieted down.\n",
      "`` Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that''.\n",
      "`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking'':\n",
      "He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver.\n",
      "`` And what makes you think you're going to get it, pretty boy''??\n",
      "His head snapped round and he reeled back, crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling.\n",
      "Tilghman leapt on to him, dragged him upright and hit him again, this time sending him careening against the bar.\n",
      "And I aim to have it''.\n",
      "Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor.\n",
      "In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade, who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night, was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial.\n",
      "`` Amen'', said the Reverend Doran, grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone, `` and now my brethren, it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere''.\n",
      "Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle.\n",
      "It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring, ruthless gun-slinger, and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it.\n",
      "He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street.\n",
      "Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire.\n",
      "The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store, halfway down the street.\n",
      "`` There's only one thing to move him fast, and we have it right here in this very store''.\n",
      "`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap'', he announced, `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss'em through the window''.\n",
      "All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks, run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through.\n",
      "Billy Tilghman did just that.\n",
      "Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts.\n",
      "To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising, smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old, and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet.\n",
      "He saw the most action, beat up more badmen with his bare fists, broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him.\n",
      "The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship, but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career, his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung.\n",
      "Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway, but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century.\n",
      "Bill Doolin's ambition, it appeared, was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid, and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him.\n",
      "Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang.\n",
      "Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers, named Ed Dunn, who lived at Rock Fort.\n",
      "`` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse''.\n",
      "Leaving his rifle in the wagon, Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it.\n",
      "Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire, a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day.\n",
      "Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher, Ed Dunn.\n",
      "Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck.\n",
      "He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him.\n",
      "`` Cold day'', said Tilghman, placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire.\n",

      "Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap, Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes.\n",
      "All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body.\n",
      "He strolled back to the door, whistling softly, hands still clasped behind him.\n",
      "He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive.\n",
      "But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon.\n",
      "If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly.\n",
      "Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown.\n",
      "Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck, sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed, jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then.\n",

      "But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell, Oklahoma, where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets.\n",
      "That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver.\n",
      "she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately.\n",
      "Then he would run to the toilet behind the house.\n",
      "And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school, where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade, the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure.\n",
      "when he went home at night, he took her with him in his mind, and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do, and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do.\n",
      "When he awoke in the mornings, she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh.\n",
      "Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her, too( it may have been there for a good while, since she was twenty now;;\n",
      "She would look at Jack, with that hidden something in her eyes, and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick.\n",
      "All, that is, except Jack.\n",
      "Once( this was on the third day of school) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg.\n",
      "About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him, he thought, although probably she didn't even see him.\n",
      "He jumped back, ducked and ran, crouching, down the hill away from the school.\n",
      "then he slowed to a walk.\n",
      "`` I'll get her yet'', he muttered to himself.\n",
      "`` I've got to get her''.\n",
      "He ate litle that morning, and his mother became concerned, inasmuch as he usually ate heartily.\n",
      "And if you get sick, ask the teacher to let you come home early.\n",
      "Daddy left the car for me, and I'm going to town this afternoon''.\n",
      "He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him.\n",
      "Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway, through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school.\n",
      "Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty, because girls were Charles' only apparent interest.\n",
      "`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry''.\n",
      "`` No, I mean how'd you get her to do it''??\n",
      "`` Jist like that''??\n",
      "Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it''.\n",
      "`` I never heard that''.\n",
      "Miss Langford, in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals, without socks, was out there with them, trying to get them inside.\n",
      "He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider.\n",
      "At noontime, remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids, Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys, except Charles, went off out the road to play ball.\n",
      "`` Maybe some of'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress''.\n",
      "When she appeared, two or three of the little girls jumped up and down, yelling, `` Goody, goody''.\n",
      "`` O.K.'' Charles rose also, and the two of them moved over to join the girls.\n",
      "Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls, Jack, in the middle of the line, gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards, sitting down hard, her dress flying over her head.\n",
      "While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again, Jack ran over, offered her his hand and said, `` Gosh, I'm sorry, Miss Langford.\n",
      "I didn't mean to pull so hard''.\n",
      "`` That's all right'', she said, tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes.\n",
      "With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other.\n",
      "When her hand touched his, fire went through Jack and he felt weak, but he managed somehow to get her on her feet.\n",
      "He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go.\n",
      "Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun, past Robert Allen's three-room, tarpapered house, toward the field where the other boys were playing ball, thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes.\n",
      "When he came back to the schoolhouse, his mind was made up.\n",
      "That should do it, he thought, because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work.\n",
      "The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work, too, and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack.\n",
      "`` But I've got to take a chance on it'', he told himself desperately.\n",
      "And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window, looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner, while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed, going home.\n",
      "His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think, his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child, `` How will I do it??\n",
      "The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman.\n",
      "The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished, hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: `` Look at your watch, Col. Garvier.\n",
      "It is almost time for and calinda to begin''.\n",
      "He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start.\n",
      "The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name.\n",
      "The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30, who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows.\n",
      "Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell, she also was a sadist, a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil.\n",
      "Shy, actually, he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields, in carriages and in boathouses.\n",
      "This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near.\n",
      "I belong to Master Alexander Prieur''.\n",
      "You look quite strong and healthy to me, Dandy''.\n",
      "Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau, she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees.\n",
      "Satisfied at last, and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts, she opened the window and called to her liveried driver.\n",
      "I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase.\n",
      "If the old fool argues about the price, tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer.\n",
      "One less shouldn't matter to him''.\n",
      "His bold eyes raked the woman, and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner.\n",
      "Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street.\n",
      "Really, you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself'', he said, frowning with displeasure.\n",
      "`` Dandy is to be our house guest, Louis.\n",
      "The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave.\n",
      "Had Dandy been older or wiser, instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life.\n",
      "Besides, her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth.\n",
      "So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home.\n",
      "Airless and dingy though it was, the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John.\n",
      "He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber.\n",
      "It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening, for the room was to become his prison cell.\n",
      "Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion, the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball, to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited.\n",
      "You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home''.\n",
      "Delphine stood like stone, her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse.\n",
      "It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came, for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest.\n",
      "Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs''.\n",
      "Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die.\n",
      "The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder, and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady.\n",
      "The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital.\n",
      "Then, on July 2, there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip.\n",
      "Mrs. Victor Dominique, socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries, chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight.\n",
      "She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back.\n",
      "the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street.\n",
      "`` Bastards'', he would say, `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff, and the first chair clobbered me''!!\n",
      "Since then, and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero, he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper.\n",
      "Ever since all that.\n",
      "It had been a very long time that had no form and no end.\n",
      "Out and out and never to return again.\n",
      "She pulled her legs up under her, to rise, her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs, and Feathertop's music pfffted away.\n",
      "`` Now that is a very nice, a very nice'', he murmured to himself, back in his corner.\n",
      "A little thing, but the right twist for the action that counted.\n",
      "Hot, that was the word, hot!!\n",
      "Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings, with the sun shining down over them.\n",
      "He was less to see, but Feathertop took him in, too, just to keep the records straight.\n",
      "Curly hair, high cheekbones, wide gnomelike mouth, a pair of drummer's blocky hands, and a body that said well, maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished.\n",
      "`` None of that.\n",
      "`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do.\n",
      "These two were going to be easy pickins.\n",
      "He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it.\n",
      "`` Come sit'', he repeated, motioning to the piled hay bags, over the pig leavings.\n",
      "She started to move toward the hay bags, dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her.\n",
      "Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim, trim legs as she walked to the bags, and tucked them beneath her, smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle.\n",
      "Slug the kid, grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll.\n",
      "They lapsed into silence, and the freight wallowed up a hill, scooted down the other side, shaking and clanking to itself.\n",
      "After a while, Kitty murmured something to Cappy, and he held her close, answering, `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly, honey''.\n",
      "Certainly not, I mean, no that isn't what I said''!!\n",
      "We haven't had anything to eat all day''.\n"

      "Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe, and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster.\n",
      "The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths, and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold.\n",
      "Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up, under doors, around loosened window frames, from the sleeping porches, the attic, from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof.\n",
      "Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen, which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed, and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma's room.\n",
      "It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them, like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive.\n",
      "The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms.\n",
      "they moved Maggie's bed and the baby's basket there, and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds.\n",
      "Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days, and it was the way people ought to live, only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to.\n",
      "Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything, and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin.\n",
      "She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it, and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever.\n",
      "`` You're working up to something, and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything, even a depression''.\n",
      "`` The only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it'', Eugenia said.\n",
      "They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her, but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out, and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way.\n",
      "She didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room, especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway, and she insisted that Hope have the heater.\n",
      "Hope wouldn't hear of it, and she took the heater back to Grandma's room, and Grandma took it back to Hope's room, and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire.\n",
      "She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room, and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it.\n",
      "Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way, but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it, so Grandma had to give in.\n",
      "`` Thrifty of her to use it up.\n",
      "She's married that tenant!!\n",
      "This ought to simplify Tolley's life''.\n",
      "Laban had more to say.\n",
      "Tolley had gone to live in California.\n",
      "He'd mentioned it, himself, at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy Robards.\n",
      "`` It was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it, Mamma.\n",
      "Zion stayed to get my pin, but it'll be a cold day in June when I go back''.\n",
      "Kizzie turned to go inside.\n",
      "You told me to bring my camera.\n",
      "Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny!!\n",
      "This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants, and I am going to see that everybody at Mt. Pleasant understands that simple fact.\n",
      "They're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long!!\n",
      "`` Make your confession to God, Kizzie dear, not to the congregation''.\n",
      "`` I'll decide that when I get there.\n",
      "I was so cruel to Tolley, so unfair.\n",
      "What else was there to say??\n",
      "Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips:\n",
      "He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message, but he felt better about Kizzie, and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole, wondering why he had preserved it.\n",
      "If he died before she did, she would never be unable to resist opening it.\n",
      "In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons, making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own.\n",
      "It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing.\n",
      "Reaching for an old clay pot, relic of pioneer days, he tore the envelope in pieces, dropping them into it, touching the little pyre to flame, watching it curl, the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash.\n",
      "A beautiful and haunting line, a subtle genius, Swinburne, difficult not to envy a gifted man, and perhaps he did.\n",
      "But this last time he drank not to Brace but `` To Tolley''!!\n",
      "Mr. Robards -- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too easygoing.\n",
      "It didn't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say, `` Howdy, Miss Jenny'', adding a careless `` Roy'', but it did her.\n",
      "He could put a stop to it, she told him again and again.\n",
      "Mr. Robards laughed, said he'd feel a damn fool, plain-out couldn't do that even to please her.\n",
      "He really hadn't meant to, he assured her, but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards.\n",
      "How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings, and fail her in -- spiritual ways.\n",
      "Another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking, which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley's.\n",
      "For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny, going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall.\n",
      "Gunny invariably tried to bite her.\n",
      "Never, `` Quit that, you sor'l devil''!!\n",
      "Never concern for his wife's nerves, or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January.\n",
      "Listening for hours to his laments that the war and `` Mist Fair's'' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph, and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come, Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it.\n",
      "Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- Tolley, the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband, his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition, her disgusting swollen stomach.\n",
      "Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards.\n",
      "Jenny's aversion to having Dr. Dunne, a former admirer, seemed silly to him, but he would humor her, get anybody she wanted, the best never being too good for her.\n",
      "The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came, she was sure.\n",
      "Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter, rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment, fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe, tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house.\n",
      "Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. Dunne, feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets.\n",
      "There was something not nice about triplets, though their father seemed pleased, showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted, saying, `` You don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day, Miss Jen, hon.\n",
      "`` She was mighty good to you past times, an' this'll fetch her''.\n",
      "Of course she wasn't herself right now, but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it.\n",
      "So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw, full of criticisms about the changes here, giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year, saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather, was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer.\n",
      "Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married, though you'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round.\n",
      "Oh, she'd come to see them once, left silver teething rings for all of the trips.\n",
      "But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call, Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial, for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there.\n",
      "More and more, these days, she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her, over to Tillie's and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts, chickens and cats and pups under the house, everybody friendly inside, making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies.\n",
      "Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks, she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land, too.\n",
      "It made him pretty hot under the collar, after the idea Miss Sis had given him, to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next, if you please, and that much as she regretted it, they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children.\n",
      "She hoped they were well.\n",
      "`` A swell party, send an invite to ever'body but them -- those folks you met at the Galt House, the ones I've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair, the whole dang neighborhood.\n",
      "I'll see word gets round''.\n",
      "Miss Jen was funny that way, funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and perk up.\n",
      "Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town.\n",
      "Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely, told her to hop in, and he'd give her a lift to Quinzaine.\n",
      "`` He must have forgiven me'', Henrietta murmured to the room.\n",
      "The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that;;\n",
      "Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman.\n",
      "She found herself wishing an old wish, that she had told Doaty she was running away, that she had left something more behind her than the loving, sorry note and her best garnet pin.\n",
      "There had been more to know about Hetty, inevitably, and most of it unfavorable.\n",
      "It was safe to assume that Papa, sighing heavily, had said many times to his remaining daughter, `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this'', and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave, with her hand in Charles' hand, just because her `` poor mother'' was gone already and would never know.\n",
      "one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her.\n",
      "She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice.\n",
      "Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice.\n",
      "Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone.\n",
      "A curious thought to end a curious night.\n",
      "The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music, and light was beginning to creep across the room, touching sill and door, table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf.\n",
      "Before anything else, she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden.\n",
      "It had always seemed to rain there, and even the grass was gray.\n",
      "After the sad impatient moment, waiting for comfort which could not come, she slipped out of bed and went to the open window.\n",
      "Leaning out, she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle, one not quite come to bloom, one just beyond it.\n",
      "It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things, but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age.\n",
      "Rosa, unbelievably, was not yet up and about, reassurance that Rosa was human.\n",
      "Outside, the garden, the tame wilderness, yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies, sweet william, scented stock and lady's bedstraw, which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa, who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly.\n",
      "The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers, supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.\n",
      "She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home.\n",
      "The cemetery slumbered just behind it, and the way lay through the village and close to the sea.\n",
      "For the first time in thirty years, Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity.\n",
      "An old man, sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him, gave her a more than reflective look as she passed, the sap still plainly rising in his branches.\n",
      "He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition, announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time.\n",
      "`` Summer's been slow to come'', he said.\n",
      "`` I'm taking them to the cemetery'', said Henrietta, out of a vague feeling of hospitality.\n",
      "It's dryin' myself out that does it''.\n",
      "`` You'd like to hear how I go about it''.\n",
      "His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text.\n",
      "Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would, and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense.\n",
      "My dad did it, and he lived to a great age''.\n",
      "Next to the Blackwells, Titus had owned the island most, and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him, silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner, more aged than possible.\n",
      "He had never spoken once to the awed sisters, but his son had been friendly, a big fellow of fifty or more, a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea.\n",
      "It must be that son who sat before her now, shriveled to half his size and half his senses.\n",
      "`` You do seem to'', said Henrietta, impressed.\n",
      "Any harm in that''??\n",
      "`` You'd be the one to say'', he observed, and she found herself liking his approval none too well, but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different'', since all actions had their own laws.\n",
      "Only, this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's open censure.\n",
      "Well, she had not come back to Great Island to be understood, praised or condemned.\n",
      "She had come to make her peace with the past, and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow.\n",
      "She started to move away, just as a woman came out of the cottage, a big-boned, drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress.\n",
      "She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man.\n",
      "`` He's lowly today'', his grand-daughter said wearily, and bent to pick it up.\n",
      "He looked piously to heaven and said, `` Beer don't affect the tissues none'', and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence.\n",
      "I've got a day's work to do.\n",
      "She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up, patiently, with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old.\n",
      "He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house, shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength.\n",
      "Henrietta looked down at her bouquet, still lively with its color and scent, and set her feet on their journey's way again, leaving the village street and crossing the first field, Folly dancing ahead of her.\n",
      "At the edge of the field, the wild rolling land took over, dotted with fat round bushes like sheep.\n",
      "She felt mindless, walking, and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery, and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty.\n",
      "Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them( how many things had lessened while she was gone away) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding'' seemed suddenly impossible.\n",
      "She sat down on the nearest, fallen with age and gray with sea-damp, her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss.\n",
      "The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold, and she wished she had brought her parasol, if only to shade Doaty's flowers.\n",
      "A pitiful few of them are left now, to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants, which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians.\n",
      "She was taller than most Japanese girls, and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall.\n",
      "Her nose was higher of bridge, her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn, and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong.\n",
      "Her mouth, soft and full, was something for any man to dream about.\n",
      "she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego, Bremerton, the Great Lakes, Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted.\n",
      "Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward.\n",
      "There were no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high.\n",
      "At present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore, because the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours.\n",
      "Tommy was interested in psychiatry, because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients.\n",
      "Such as now, when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the Officers' Club, having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime.\n",
      "She had changed into a cocktail dress, and the whole evening should have been before her, but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck.\n",
      "if Tommy sat long enough, she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long Beach.\n",
      "And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there.\n",
      "he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong, and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant.\n",
      "There was a fifty-fifty chance, perhaps, that he would be unmarried, and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different.\n",
      "Japan did something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan, either, because the same thing applied anywhere overseas.\n",
      "it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it, and, therefore, why not??\n",
      "He said, turning on what was meant to be charm.\n",
      "`` I don't believe I know you, and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English, wasn't it''??\n",
      "At least, he had the decency to blush, she thought.\n",
      "The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy.\n",
      "Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any of those places, nobody had suggested that she wasn't American.\n",
      "Four little Japanese waitresses were murdering the English language at the counter -- Yuki Kobayashi happened to be one of them.\n",
      "Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called, `` Bifutek-san''!!\n",
      "Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables, both quite pretty and well groomed.\n",
      "But she was learning that so long as she was in this country, and wore civilian dress in the Club, there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English.\n",
      "after coming to America, her parents had spoken only English.\n",
      "She had been sent to the wrong place for duty.\n",
      "There was more to service in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in the ward.\n",
      "One had to have friends, and a congenial life in after-duty hours.\n",
      "It was terribly off key, and poorly done, and Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing, but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon.\n",
      "Then, after a while, she went to her mirror.\n",
      "And, still, they did not have to be so crude in their approach.\n",
      "There was a letter to write to her mother, and she tried to make its tone cheerful.\n",
      "She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen, on the island of Oyajima -- which was not very far from Yokosuka.\n",
      "And tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown.\n",
      "Actually, this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water.\n",
      "Doc Doolittle's scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing, because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature, and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report.\n",
      "But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual, too, and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing.\n",
      "Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know.\n"

      "`` Nice to know you.\n",
      "Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch''??\n",
      "Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play, a loss of ten dollars.\n",
      "This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx, so he walked on down to Hurrays, an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf.\n",
      "he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction.\n",
      "He was shorter and fatter than Owen, who felt good standing next to him.\n",

      "Spencer was quiet for a moment longer, then he said, `` There is nothing I want to say, Captain''.\n",
      "`` Very well''.\n",
      "Philip Spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain, yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address.\n",
      "During the morning hours, it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers.\n",
      "Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty, so as to be near Spencer, watching an opportunity to communicate with him.\n",
      "There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain.\n",
      "Heiser, breathless and wild-eyed, brought the chilling news that the handspikes, heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places.\n",
      "McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that'' --\n",
      "Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who'' --\n",
      "A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away.\n",
      "Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander's side.\n",
      "`` Small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast.\n",
      "And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken, for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to obey.\n",
      "Then, with disappointment evident upon their faces, they moved to the work.\n",
      "Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil, thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed.\n",
      "Their strategy was sound enough and, he reasoned, had been defeated only by Philip Spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated.\n",
      "When the mast was raised, Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest, and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers.\n",
      "Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later, with back turned, had been attacked by Wilson, brandishing the weapon.\n",
      "In the tiny cabin, Alexander met with Gansevoort, Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen.\n",
      "Gansevoort said, `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely.\n",
      "To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed.\n",
      "From actions aboard, it is easy to guess that Spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate''.\n",
      "`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners.\n",
      "Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States, they will be punished but that in the meanwhile, they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order.\n",
      "Mr. Heiser, does this sound like a truly workable plan to you??\n",
      "They are about to do so at any moment as it is.\n",
      "All that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead.\n",
      "As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer, we are going to be rushed.\n",
      "We are going to be rushed and murdered''.\n",
      "We are not going to be rushed and murdered'', Alexander said.\n",
      "`` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound''.\n",
      "A great deal of labor we have as well, for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed''.\n",
      "And when he was alone again in the cabin, Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept, for he knew full well what must be done, what in the end would be done.\n",
      "And when he did, when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor, he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul.\n",
      "He who had tried so hard, who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer.\n",
      "It came to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven.\n",
      "God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired, for it had not been with an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career.\n",
      "Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist.\n",
      "It was for love that he had served the Navy.\n",
      "To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for.\n",
      "Stern-faced, he inspected the prisoners, satisfying himself that they were clean, well fed and comfortable within reason.\n",
      "He leaned closer to Alexander, squinting up at him from the deck.\n",
      "You were careful about that''.\n",
      "Now Spencer, seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy, spoke.\n",
      "Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer.\n",
      "The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell.\n",
      "Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled.\n",
      "There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer, in handcuffs and ankle irons, knew it to be a truth.\n",
      "He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune.\n",
      "The red-haired captain, towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority, was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer.\n",
      "`` Spencer, if there is guilt, if you do not deny your own, how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent??\n",
      "I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell''.\n",
      "`` Nothing to lose, either, Spencer''.\n",
      "His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea.\n",
      "And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth, still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell.\n",
      "No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen, prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper, had seen it in Cromwell's hands while Spencer whispered explanations.\n",
      "`` I thought'', Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander, `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry''.\n",
      "It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom, where a class of apprentices awaited him.\n",
      "Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah.\n",
      "I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road.\n",
      "I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel.\n",
      "Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings.\n",
      "We entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor.\n",
      "Rachel talked to him.\n",
      "I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed, but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor.\n",
      "He stopped in front of a door, placed a finger on his lips, and, still peering down into his beard, pushed open the door to a classroom.\n",
      "His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat.\n",
      "They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick.\n",
      "They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher.\n",
      "Since they did not glance curiously at us once, I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction.\n",
      "His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders.\n",
      "My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys.\n",
      "We walked down the cool hall silently.\n",
      "From behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer.\n",
      "I said, `` How long do they keep that up''??\n",
      "He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish.\n",
      "Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man.\n",
      "She smiled to herself.\n",
      "When we were fighting, a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass.\n",
      "They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah''.\n",
      "You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home.\n",
      "You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.\n",
      "You had to know, also, that you were going to fail.\n",
      "She wished to change much for the children here''.\n",
      "But when she saw the children you have just visited, she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country, in the kibbutzim.\n",
      "When she loved, it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved.\n",
      "Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted.\n",
      "She stayed here to work for Aliah.\n",
      "Ready to follow her impulse.\n",
      "It was an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel.\n",
      "Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos.\n",
      "Here they did not need to be in ghettos.\n",
      "She set out to make sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this''.\n",
      "I said quietly, gaining nerve, ready to ask any question at all, no matter how intimate, ready to be rebuffed, `` Then why did she leave Israel??\n",
      "I'd like to know that very much''.\n",
      "She pursed her lips, then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me.\n",
      "But she had to go out and hurt herself.\n",
      "There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her.\n",
      "This refugee was a middle-aged man, a big, handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen.\n",
      "Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one.\n",
      "Your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off, and she would send him home to his son.\n",
      "He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him.\n",
      "Then his son did something'' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what, but something, to an official here -- it was during the Mandate -- and the son was imprisoned.\n",
      "She went to the father and found he had hanged himself''.\n",
      "Then she continued with energy, `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father.\n",
      "She said, `` Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee.\n",
      "He complained to me once that I must talk to her.\n",
      "When I did, she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him.\n",
      "He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him.\n",
      "She came to me one day.\n",
      "And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal.\n",
      "He took her to a doctor, for she was run down, nervous, did not care where she was.\n",
      "He did not let her talk to people;;\n",
      "For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time, making his plans as he went, she had begun dreaming too.\n",
      "`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot??\n",
      "Out of the church and into his big car, it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college, his expansiveness, the quaint little pine board tourist courts, cabins really, with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight, like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs, watching in between your bouts at hopscotch), a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls, an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving.\n",
      "And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice, the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain, so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened.\n",
      "Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen.\n",
      "Or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open, not because you meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear, but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant, but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice: `` I think I'm pregnant''.\n",
      "You could wish that.\n",
      "So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights, waiting for you, for your new spectator pumps, waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt, crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off, because that is being an old maid too, if you happen to drive a car, it is changing the tire yourself in the night, and in the mud and the rain, hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help.\n",
      "And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell, a combination like ham and eggs, rape her and kill her, and that is being an old maid too.\n",
      "It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull.\n",
      "And most of all it is not having the only man you could love, whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds, or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines, for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one.\n",
      "And he can be on the way to Memphis, your Gratt Shafer can, and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead.\n",
      "Even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give, the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it, even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe, and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie.\n",
      "Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift, and it is he inside of you.\n",
      "You feel where he is and what he sees, and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman, the one that never could love him the way you do, the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't.\n",
      "And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him, and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy, the chump who begged you to marry him, the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes.\n",
      "You think: `` Did he feel that way about me''??\n",
      "It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer;;\n",
      "that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him, that other guy.\n",
      "It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you, he was a man, and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable, you were passing it down to him, to Gratt Shafer's substitute, that other guy.\n",
      "And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis, where he got to be a big unhappy success.\n",
      "You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it, and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself, to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you.\n",
      "Homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway, instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart, while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments.\n",
      "The others, the ones in the stands, were spellbound, for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City.\n",
      "He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day.\n",
      "If a man was good, if he was going to be governor, you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever.\n",
      "He hit the theme about dying to defend your country, and you were ready to do it right then, without a second thought.\n",
      "While he talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world, no matter if it hadn't, in six weeks, rained enough to wet a rat's ass.\n",
      "Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids, back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four, which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions, like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down.\n",
      "She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door, just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might, someday, break away the pipe connections from the wall.\n",
      "The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out, by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching, whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot.\n",
      "Among us, we three handled quite a few small commissions, from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs.\n",
      "He also drew precise crisp spots, which he sold to various literary and artistic journals, The New Yorker, for instance, or Esquire.\n",
      "I did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints: naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway, daring the cops to take him, is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver.\n",
      "the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3,, and I did a week of research to get the details just right: the fifteenth-century armor, furnishings, clothes.\n",
      "and in the third place, it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold''.\n",
      "They know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy, and only the villains had beards.\n",
      "And girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough''.\n",
      "he sold perhaps three or four a year, and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends.\n",
      "There was the freshness of color, the freedom of perception, the lack of self-consciousness, but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye.\n",
      "We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted.\n",
      "he would look right through you while you were talking to him, and if you said, `` For Christ's sake, Donald, you've got Prussian blue all over your shirt'', he would smile, and nod, and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well.\n",
      "Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery, and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting.\n",
      "It was all gravy, and Donald didn't need much to live on;;\n",
      "I wanted to paint again.\n",
      "It wasn't just the pressure of work, although that was the excuse I often used, even to myself.\n",
      "It was the kind of work I was doing, the quality of the ambition it awoke in me, that kept me from painting.\n",
      "I kept saying, `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself, make some real money, get to be well known as an illustrator -- like Peter Askington, for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint''.\n",
      "I had admired him long before I talked to him.\n",
      "It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want, joy in his work, standing in the profession, a large and steady income.\n",
      "This set his tone: richness of texture and color, and another kind of richness as well, for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off's rent for a year.\n",
      "the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain.\n",
      "We went into Mrs. Monmouth's library, which had low bookshelves all along the walls, and above them a Modigliani portrait, a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long, and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background, that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb.\n",
      "In the course of our talk, Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying.\n",
      "`` I don't think I've reached the point, yet, where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft.\n",
      "Besides, it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere, an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters, as Durer went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna''.\n",
      "`` The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no, he is more than that, a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic.\n",
      "One of these days, I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days, from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism, and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other.\n",
      "just listening to him made me feel intelligent.\n",
      "`` I'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima'', he went on, `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton''.\n",
      "I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen, and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's''.\n",
      "I've always admired him, and when I heard he was taking a few pupils, I went to him and joined his class''.\n",
      "They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint, and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life.\n",
      "In the Middle Ages, in the Renaissance, right up to the early nineteenth century, the painter was a giant in the world.\n",
      "What we need is to get back to the group, to learning and apprenticeship, to the cafe and the school''.\n",
      "The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather, of the studio in which he gave his classes, for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class, which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning.\n",
      "It was an awkward hour, but I didn't have to punch any time clock, and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job.\n",
      "After a short time, both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely, and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work.\n",
      "I don't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be.\n",
      "I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic, and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars.\n",
      "No, that isn't quite fair.\n",
      "Actually, there was a lot of force in him, which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week.\n",
      "Such a little thing to start with -- the car registration.\n",
      "Had she forgotten she had signed the car away, that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children??\n",
      "I didn't want to stir things up.\n",
      "`` I'm sure she'd turn it over to you, if you'd rather.\n",
      "You know that''.\n",
      "`` She must have taken the registration when she went to Walter's.\n",
      "Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind??\n",
      "I was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace, and then the lawyer would tear up all those things\n",
      "`` It narrows down down down and finally there is no way out.\n",
      "If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing''.\n",
      "I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark, but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in.\n",
      "I felt more cheerful, as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself.\n",
      "And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life.\n",
      "It was foggy that evening, but the path to my house was so well grooved that I could feel my way, accustomed as I was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days.\n",
      "In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on.\n",
      "I did my shopping, had my dentist appointment, and from there I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar, so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon.\n",
      "Why, when I drove down to church, didn't it speak to me, seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear??\n",
      "Prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember, and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove, absent itself, unsee.\n",
      "Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong, and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house.\n",
      "She screamed, and both women ran up to the house, and I followed.\n",
      "The search began, in all the rooms, running upstairs, down, opening closets, talking, exclaiming in rushes and gasps.\n",
      "I, who until that day before had been Mrs. Salter's friend, her equal, was the servant now.\n",
      "And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me.\n",
      "And after I brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait.\n",
      "Sitting in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me.\n",
      "`` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing''.\n",
      "Why didn't that alarm me then??\n",
      "And when she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said, `` All they talked about was Harvie Harvie this, Harvie that When they know the truth will they drop away from me, will I become a nothing''??\n",
      "And then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast, over and over again, `` On the boat people liked me for myself''.\n",
      "I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage, just to check.\n",
      "Then was it a final desperate plea from her, to whom??\n",
      "I tried to believe that what must have happened was that, restless, disturbed by this telephone call or whatever, she walked out in the night, as she had a habit of doing.\n",
      "Sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff.\n",
      "It's so romantic up there, she used to say, with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night, so poetic.\n",
      "With all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock, a misstep.\n",
      "But I didn't really think it was as simple as that, nor did anyone else.\n",
      "When a fisherman brought her up in his arms, still, small, as if she were a child asleep, I began to shudder with a terrible excitement, almost triumphant, that I still cannot account for.\n",
      "Or what was it that, before Via, Sonny, Walter and all, I began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out, `` I knew she'd do it!!\n",
      "At the same time that I thought I understood her at long last and pitied her, underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate, an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry??\n",
      "Was that what had given way in me??\n",
      "It is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family I considered my very own, but there it hangs, a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other.\n",
      "At the time I was filled with self-pity at this separation, but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry.\n",
      "In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her, so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it, I can understand that by now and love them still, because everyone must justify, have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne.\n",
      "It is not their avoidance that rankles;;\n",
      "it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family, and therefore of mine, and they nod to me so coolly and walk away, that it hurts.\n",
      "she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country.\n",
      "It was coarse, almost insulting, this harsh appraisal, and she has never come to see me since.\n",
      "But suppose she had not taken Mrs. Mathias' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns, dispossessed of love, hanging on to makeshifts, and altogether and finally arid.\n",
      "If she chose, and in that final decision discarded, what, above all, all of us value, life itself, must she not have risen to her fullest height, and transcending her murky self, felt at last the passion of a great moral decision??\n",
      "Yes, I had cried out that I knew she'd do it, but without my fully realizing it at the time, it was a cry of triumph for her, praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt.\n"

      "The funeral service was in the house, the Methodist minister, how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside, a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words, and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment, seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed.\n",
      "Then Via called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had Ellen, the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning.\n",
      "I knelt, just for decency I thought at the time, but found myself whispering, `` Our Father which Art in Heaven'' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief.\n",

      "I think I was what you might call a convivial man, and yet it was when I was alone in my studio, doing my work, that I really felt alive.\n",
      "But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with''.\n",
      "Pausing, he waited for her to turn, to ask a question.\n",
      "`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot.\n",
      "He asked, trying to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed;;\n",
      "`` You talk so well, Carla'', he went on.\n",
      "`` You seem to have read so much, you have a natural gift for words'', he added, trying to flatter her vanity.\n",
      "Where did you go to school''??\n",
      "Why are you trying to worry me''??\n",
      "`` I'm not trying to worry you''.\n",
      "At home he had been a clean orderly man, and now he had to hide his annoyance.\n",
      "Would he have to clean up after her every day, clean the kitchen, the bathroom, and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor, then hang up her dresses, pick up her stockings, make the bed while she lay around??\n",
      "He straightened up, ready to vent his exasperation, then grew afraid.\n",
      "`` Maybe I could'', he said, surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him.\n",
      "`` And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit'', she said, making a face.\n",
      "He had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street.\n",
      "Changing his clothes, he put on his dark-blue flannel suit, and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good.\n",
      "She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli.\n",
      "They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via Veneto, then they went to the Farnese Gardens.\n",

      "Aren't you going out to mass??\n",
      "You could take me to St. Peter's''.\n",
      "`` I think I'll sleep in this morning'', she said drowsily, and as she snuggled against him, he wondered if she ever went to church.\n",
      "Why did he want her to go to church??\n",
      "She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible.\n",
      "From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know.\n",

      "All the ideologies changing from day to day, right under his eyes, so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom??\n",
      "Just the same, he thought, pondering over it, it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church.\n",
      "A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros, hearing them hurrying down the stairs, would think they were going to a late mass.\n",
      "It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them, could place them, it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla.\n",
      "`` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon'', he said, `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us''.\n",

      "She wanted to know.\n",
      "Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars.\n",
      "Just the same, the old woman said, she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country.\n",
      "It was said that he had had a vision.\n",
      "Just as thousands that day in Portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky, he had seen the same thing later in his own garden, and she turned to Agnese for confirmation.\n",
      "The Holy Father would die soon, she said to Carla, so she could translate for Sam, although he had a brilliant doctor, a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world.\n",
      "There would be changes made, and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome.\n",
      "Indeed he did, Sam said solemnly, trying to get Carla's eye.\n",

      "But one night Dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's lodge, where Shades of Night had gone to purify herself.\n",
      "In her dark, scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination, afraid of nothing, not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding.\n",
      "Even he, wanting her, afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit, feared the evil presences in her metabolism more.\n",
      "Going, he saw as often before some queer, hideous yellow face over his head, shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs.\n",
      "He cried out to her, his back turned.\n",
      "Then he fled, not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry.\n",
      "Early Spring came from her bed, from beside her half-drunk husband, Walitzee, and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion, the sound of hushed voices.\n",
      "Standing there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge, silent, almost imperious, her body taut, simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited, perhaps denying the dread that moved in her.\n",
      "But the girl said only, `` Tell him I am here, that I have come''.\n",
      "I will tell you to go, not begging.\n",
      "`` You bring only wickedness'', she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal.\n",
      "Speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl, who stood with the same upright, scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife.\n",
      "`` Go take helsq'iyokom, your evil spirit, to the young boys'', the woman said.\n",
      "`` They do not have to face battle.\n",
      "The other women had come close now, their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot, their threats mingling, rising, nagging at each other, each trying to make her indignation and anger felt.\n",
      "But she did not move, taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly Pile of Clouds came howling among them, swinging a great bullhide whip.\n",
      "`` Go back to your lodges''!!\n",
      "He made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming, some tripping over themselves in their flight.\n",
      "Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband''!!\n",
      "`` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women.\n",
      "Keep him back, if you must tell me what to do.\n",
      "I will be the one to confront my daughter, not the wife of him who leads her to sin''!!\n",
      "She retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where Walitzee stirred, mumbling, sitting up in a half stupor to say:\n",
      "But she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness, smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from TuHulHulZote.\n",
      "She said, `` There is nothing that concerns you here.\n",
      "Lie back and go to sleep.\n",
      "Outside, the old man, beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore, went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms.\n",
      "And, shoving her against a spruce, her back to him, he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air, shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked, settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged, as dark and motionless as ever, her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face.\n",
      "She said to him, her father, `` How was I begotten, in pain or joy??\n",
      "Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me??\n",
      "`` Did you follow me to see my shame??\n",
      "Then, without knowing why, she found herself running from them, fleeing wildly through the trees, dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid, listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry.\n",
      "And a very young one, Swan Necklace, tried to emulate them and followed timidly.\n",
      "They combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love.\n",
      "They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance.\n",
      "The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears.\n",
      "If I ever committed suicide, she thought, I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days.\n",
      "She smiled, and expertly let herself downward, holding this known root or that, her sneakers sliding in the leaves.\n",
      "Perhaps it was because it was so late, and because she had no business to be here now.\n",
      "And then off he went so casually, to someone else with breasts better developed, more obvious in a lower-cut dress, someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him.\n",
      "I wish he was with me now, she thought, and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment.\n",
      "It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch;;\n",
      "but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning.\n",
      "He would not be indebted to Sam!!\n",
      "He was walking across to the bathroom.\n",
      "Sam would be amazed to find him gone.\n",
      "Millie would have to understand.\n",
      "He found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness.\n",
      "Alex Poldowski -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman.\n",
      "A quarter to seven.\n",
      "He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces.\n",
      "He was supposed to be in court this afternoon, at City Hall.\n",
      "He'd have to think, but the main thing, the imperative necessity, was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about, and before Millie detained him with sympathy.\n",
      "He was actually walking down the stairs.\n",
      "A plane up in the sky, above the clouds, and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away.\n",
      "`` Father, is that you''??\n",
      "`` Is that you, Father??\n",
      "Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room.\n",
      "He was trying to smile at her.\n",
      "Just about to call a taxi''.\n",
      "`` Well, at least you won't have to do that'', she was saying.\n",
      "`` I'm about to leave myself.\n",
      "`` I'm going back to school'', she answered.\n",
      "Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight.\n",
      "She asked, in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated, considerate, and yet perhaps partly scornful.\n",
      "He tried to see her face more clearly.\n",
      "`` I have to say good-bye upstairs.\n",
      "`` Not to anyone''??\n",
      "I wouldn't have the strength to answer, he thought.\n",
      "`` I'll take that, Julie -- for you''.\n",
      "but that didn't matter.\n",
      "To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this;;\n",
      "He could not stop to analyze.\n",
      "He had never felt particularly close to her.\n",
      "`` I wish I didn't have to go back to school'', she said, and then, `` I wish you lived in New York.\n",
      "`` I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume, and that we could go to a theater together, or a nice restaurant, forget we knew'' He stopped speaking.\n",
      "`` I know you feel badly, but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say''.\n",
      "I'm supposed to joke about things, aren't I??\n",
      "What happened to you''??\n",
      "He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it.\n",
      "Just one or two swallows, he told himself, enough to lessen some of the pain.\n",
      "Tell Sam not to worry about the car.\n",
      "There was one more call to make.\n",
      "Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night.\n",
      "Unfortunately it turned out to be me, but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss.\n",
      "I won't be in town for a couple of days, though, and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon.\n",
      "I'd win hands down.\n",
      "I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement -- it's really just a routine thing.\n",
      "I'll bribe you with a nice'' -- He was about to say `` double martini'' but thought better of it.\n",
      "`` I'll take you out to dinner.\n",
      "He had put down the receiver.\n",
      "yet if he said: Make an excuse yourself, come out here today, she would have been on the next train -- and, similarly, if she had been in need, he would have gone to her.\n",
      "`` That's a peculiar way to think''.\n",
      "It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers, of course;;\n",
      "she knew that.\n",
      "It's a long way to Websterville''.\n",
      "`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy.\n",
      "It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so, she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful''.\n",
      "Leaving Cathy with them, Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit;;\n",
      "Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg, Myra's husband, hadn't gone out to fetch her.\n",
      "`` You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time.\n",
      "You'll see, Myra's settling down''.\n",
      "On the defensive, he added, `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg, to be a new widow, a young widow''.\n",
      "Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it.\n",
      "And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down.\n",
      "It seemed to Lucy that all their married life, she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life.\n",
      "Remembering that succession of disasters, she now considered Cathy, an ominous child-cloud on her horizon.\n",
      "It was not that she disliked Cathy.\n",
      "whenever Lucy saw her, she tried, without noise or fuss, to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra.\n",
      "`` I wouldn't even be surprised'', she said unhappily, `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever''.\n",
      "Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible.\n",
      "`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of''!!\n",
      "Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said, he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy.\n",
      "He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up, fiercely, `` Susan!!\n",
      "Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river??\n",
      "`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen.\n",
      "The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless, selfish sister of his.\n",
      "`` Well, at last'', she said, because Susan was clattering down the stairs.\n",
      "`` Do you need that big bundle''??\n",
      "His voice had sharp edges, as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment.\n",
      "`` All that junk''??\n",
      "Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief;;\n",
      "to her, each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart.\n",
      "And when you get back from Grandma's, Cathy will be here to play with you.\n",
      "there ought to be a limit to sharing, too.\n",
      "That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit, short or long;;\n",
      "She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had.\n",
      "When the car, with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window, disappeared down the driveway, Lucy stood looking after its pale dust.\n",
      "She was sorry, and angry at herself, because never in their life together had she done that.\n",
      "She turned and began to walk toward the house.\n",
      "She said to herself, abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds.\n",
      "She had a day of things to do;;\n",
      "among them, she had to prepare the guest room.\n",
      "For a moment, her mind returned again to the strange, flying world of birds, and she said to herself.\n",
      "It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests.\n",
      "There were new yellow curtains, bright as a child's life ought to be, a new bedspread, lively with hopping rabbits, and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile, spinning slowly in the breeze.\n",
      "since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back, Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed.\n",
      "Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her.\n",
      "for Mother to be able to call, Susan must be napping now, surrounded by her multitude of dolls.\n",
      "Lucy drew out the chair and sat down;;\n",
      "On her way to the airport, on her way to Paris -- you bet, Lucy said to herself.\n",
      "There was a momentary pause, and then her mother said, `` How long is she supposed to stay''??\n",
      "she was not usually given to mysterious silences.\n",
      "Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good??\n",
      "`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris''??\n",
      "Again there was that curious pause, and then her mother said, `` I guess I do.\n",
      "Just before Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy, and she didn't realize I was near''.\n",
      "Then she jumped to her feet, the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake.\n",
      "Then, if Myra does nothing about fetching her, I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself''!!\n",
      "`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim''.\n",
      "For Lucy, the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.\n",
      "She's not going to get away with it.\n",
      "She was at the moment just a small, walking package, being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house.\n",
      "the worn teddy bear, a tiny suitcase that Jim carried, and the clothes she wore, were all she had.\n",
      "they would have to buy things for her.\n",
      "They walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon, nine mint, seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` Eats'' sign jiggling in the wind.\n",
      "Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge.\n",
      "His rock was to the right of a V-shaped inlet, a big, brown, lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers.\n",
      "Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe.\n",
      "He was six feet one like his father, with big hands and a hairy chest, a man the weak and persecuted would turn to.\n",
      "A dark bathroom can be pretty scary, and he'd creep back to bed, proud of himself, thinking: Tomorrow, for sure, I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad.\n",
      "He hadn't intended to make the promise.\n",
      "It happened two weeks ago, the night before his father left on a business trip to South America.\n",
      "He says you're limping more than you need to''.\n",
      "In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out.\n",
      "Or, what was worse, she prayed for him out loud at bedtime: `` Please, Lord Gord, please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised''.\n",
      "Quint said now to the clouds.\n",
      "Strength began to zip up and down his chest.\n",
      "He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks.\n",
      "The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades, and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there, bleeding, wedged between the rocks and the waves.\n",

      "When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car, the Jaguar his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday, and himself quite thoroughly with it, driving back from an afternoon's golf at Oakmont, it seemed to mark the end of a long, miswritten chapter in the social life of the community.\n",
      "Not that Linda was heartless, not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would.\n",
      "Hadn't Linda been a perfect wife to Bobbie, who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years??\n",
      "Wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way??\n",
      "Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound.\n",
      "It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life, and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his.\n",
      "`` Of course, there was nothing you could do, but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen'', Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart.\n",
      "Linda accepted the reproach, which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the Allegheny Mountains, and John was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around Pittsburgh.\n",
      "For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs.\n",
      "John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut in three and a half hours.\n",
      "First, it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more.\n",
      "And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans.\n",
      "Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action, but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe, with Edythe his bride, it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers.\n",
      "Mousie Chandler had been to school with her someplace near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at Horne's.\n",
      "Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example.\n",
      "Her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length.\n",
      "Mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity.\n",
      "He was not reduced to poverty, but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day.\n",
      "It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to.\n",
      "Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper, John's first son, came along early in 1938, the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes, nary a trace of Edythe.\n",
      "She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber, the eldest elder, who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything, had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church''.\n",
      "Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one.\n",
      "He was an attentive and generous husband, overgenerous, a lot of people felt, because they knew that money must be a problem to him.\n",
      "But he got ahead in business: on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war;;\n",
      "after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company.\n",
      "Bobbie had been successful, too, though he didn't match John's pace, and after all he didn't need to, with all the Stuart money.\n",
      "He and Linda settled down to being social leaders, and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year.\n"

      "Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling.\n",
      "What she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it, not so much sorrow for handsome, ambitious Bobbie, but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death.\n",
      "It was up to her to save Poor John, dear John, to undo the wrong she had done, but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream.\n",
      "she could be sure of that.\n",
      "It might be rough on Edythe at first, but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her, to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere.\n",
      "It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of.\n",
      "Linda would have to wait, she knew.\n",
      "Years of watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead.\n",
      "For Linda knew how to help her husband, not just the Stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy.\n",
      "She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job.\n",
      "They had their first real fight, and Bobbie went off to get drunk.\n",
      "Linda dragooned her uncle, Donald Murkland, into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened.\n",
      "But jolly old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job, but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand.\n",
      "`` I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability, so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive.\n",
      "With that wife of his, I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance.\n",
      "And also, the money can't mean as much to Bobbie.\n",
      "After the surprise was over, Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck, though she agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to move to Funk Furnaces.\n",
      "The job at Funk wasn't particularly better, but it got him away from being subordinate to John and assured him steady advancement, since Funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of Linda's family.\n",
      "Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric.\n",
      "She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night.\n",
      "`` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money.\n",
      "I could get along without that three dollars.\n",
      "In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine!!\n",
      "I answered to find Nadine at the other end.\n",
      "`` You scared me half to death'', I said shakily.\n",
      "`` Oh, she wouldn't do that'', I said.\n",
      "Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally, and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us'' --\n",

      "I'll be glad to pay you'' --\n",
      "So sure that money could do anything!!\n",
      "But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment, and if I didn't go over, who would??\n",
      "I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell, and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door.\n",
      "`` It's all right'', I said, as she started to look scared.\n",
      "I just came over to make sure everything was all right''.\n",
      "`` I'm -- hard to wake up'', she faltered.\n",
      "And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable!!\n",
      "`` I have to get up early for church tomorrow'', she went on.\n",
      "`` I didn't know it was going to be this late''!!\n",
      "I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone.\n",
      "I told Nadine everything was fine, and that I'd be getting on home.\n",
      "There was a ragged edge to her voice now, as if she'd been crying.\n",
      "`` Wally's drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can, but I don't want Shirley to see him like this.\n",
      "You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building'' --\n",
      "She didn't even give me a chance to refuse.\n",
      "Well, there wasn't any law that said I had to stay!!\n",
      "But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep, and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be, with Wally coming home drunk.\n",
      "So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning, and she scooted off to her own apartment.\n",
      "I must have dozed off, because I came to with a start at the sound of voices.\n",
      "Nadine's, shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two.\n",
      "Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out, and if looks could kill, Wally would have been dead.\n",
      "He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it, and was instantly asleep.\n",
      "Nadine strode over to him, and her pointed nails raked across his face.\n",
      "I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right, and she was crazy.\n",
      "`` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman!!\n",
      "We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs'' --\n",
      "`` you'd better simmer down'', I said nervously.\n",
      "`` How can you be so damn stupid??\n",
      "And we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours -- and all because of that'' --\n",
      "I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth.\n",
      "`` Stop that!!\n",
      "She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning.\n",
      "`` You go to bed'', I said curtly.\n",
      "It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go.\n",
      "I had done all I was going to do.\n",
      "I snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him.\n",
      "Wally sat in our big chair, his hands between his knees, looking ready to cry.\n",
      "I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business'' --\n",
      "Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job, Wally confessed, and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired.\n",
      "Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side.\n",
      "`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman''!!\n",
      "I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there.\n",
      "But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved.\n",
      "Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough.\n",
      "They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks, owing on everything they owned.\n",
      "On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent, and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired, they were evicted.\n",
      "`` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over''.\n",
      "It was easy enough to say it, because of course we couldn't spare a cent.\n",
      "`` I'm glad you feel that way, honey.\n",
      "Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money!!\n",
      "`` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this!!\n",
      "I didn't want to be like that, mean and bitter.\n",
      "But, darn it all, why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us??\n",
      "It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do.\n",
      "The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name.\n",
      "His luck had failed him, and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world.\n",
      "`` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job.\n",
      "`` Those damn punks -- taking work away from men who need it''.\n",
      "`` By fall they'll be back in school'', I'd say, trying to sound encouraging.\n",
      "I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night, when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air.\n",
      "But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes, I knew it was going to be a bad day.\n",
      "Part of it was the weather, so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital.\n",
      "Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting as well, that kept me up late.\n",
      "It was just going to be one of those days.\n",
      "I had a lot to be thankful for.\n",
      "A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at.\n",
      "Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like, but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home.\n",
      "At least, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges, bless her, to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was.\n",
      "Her first class wasn't until ten, but she always got up to have breakfast with me.\n",
      "It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all on her own, to go to college right here in town made me feel good, too.\n",
      "Oh, I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision.\n",
      "I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson, the most promising intern at Fairview, had something to do with it, too.\n",
      "But once I was alone again, driving to the hospital, the heaviness returned.\n",
      "If she and Pete were really getting serious, I'd have to do some hard thinking.\n",
      "Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years??\n",
      "The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview.\n",
      "Pete was down on Seven, Dick told me, and he'd meet us there.\n",
      "There wasn't anything of special interest that morning, no one sicker than they should have been.\n",
      "Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of post-operative shock, but it was all taken care of now.\n",
      "It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward.\n",
      "The moment I walked in, the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed.\n",
      "She looked about sixty, though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four.\n",
      "An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face, already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry.\n",
      "No, no it was an unfortunate resemblance, that was all it was, and I turned to Dick, forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind.\n",
      "Although quiet when they brought her in, she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out.\n",
      "We'd keep her a day or two, and the AA people would talk to her.\n",
      "But if she wasn't interested, she'd just go back to the same life she'd left.\n",
      "Turning toward the patient again, I -- I can't describe what happened to me then, except to say that I felt sick.\n",
      "I tell you, it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak.\n",
      "I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them, I've always thought, to chat first.\n",
      "But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away.\n",
      "It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed.\n",
      "`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it''??\n",
      "I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table.\n",
      "Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear, sent it down to the lab with a request for the test.\n",
      "That done, I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind.\n",
      "One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled.\n",
      "On my way to the elevator, I ran into Pete.\n",
      "Do you want to talk to her, Doctor''??\n",
      "`` Well'' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again.\n",
      "But that was ridiculous, of course.\n",
      "`` If you can keep her here that long'', Pete said wryly.\n",
      "`` Groggins tells me she's started badgering already, wants to get out.\n",
      "Wants to get to her booze, I guess''.\n",
      "We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter, I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar.\n",
      "But she seemed to be dozing and in any case, we'd been talking in low tones.\n",
      "`` I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson'', I said.\n",
      "`` We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage.\n",
      "That's quite minor, nothing to worry about.\n",
      "But we would like your permission to do -- that is, to go further if it proves necessary''.\n",
      "Actually, I rather doubt that we'll have to do this.\n",
      "I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here, where she couldn't get to the liquor.\n",
      "`` I'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs.\n",
      "This was someone who'd come down in the world, I thought.\n",
      "A long, long way down.\n",
      "`` I don't know what you heard that would make you think so, but I assure you I don't even know myself, so how can you be so sure??\n",
      "She could have found out my first name, of course -- that wouldn't be difficult.\n",
      "But there was that something, some echo in the way she spoke.\n",
      "Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife??\n",
      "As for coming back here -- well, I'll tell you the truth, I didn't even know where I was when I came to.\n",
      "You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good??\n",
      "Let her out, let her out -- that would be the solution, wouldn't it??\n",
      "I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea.\n",
      "While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down, a clear part sorted over recent events, among them my only positive act in a long time.\n",
      "It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris.\n",
      "Wild kicks never are, but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind.\n",
      "Once before I had been to Paris, long before I married Valery.\n",
      "I was twenty-one back then, in the army, and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main.\n",
      "All the women were beautiful, and the men were equal to them;;\n",
      "everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes.\n",
      "I had champagne at Maxim's, then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre.\n",
      "She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could, and washing it down with red wine.\n",
      "She was blonde, and young, and nice and round in a tight white dress.\n",
      "When she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill, she came directly to my table and said:\n",
      "And so off we went to her apartment.\n",
      "I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit.\n",
      "I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up.\n",
      "I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils( so help me), then switched to Tuborg.\n",
      "I went to my hotel and slept.\n",
      "All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space.\n",
      "My head was clear, my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others.\n",
      "A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value.\n",
      "I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park, and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky.\n",
      "She saw me and sat down beside me, three feet away.\n",
      "It gave her the right to sit down beside me, back straight, one hand out on the handle.\n",
      "She was another human being and happened to be a hustler.\n",
      "She was trying to make a hole in my armor, and I didn't want it.\n",
      "`` Well -- women and unhappiness go together'', I observed profoundly, adding, `` You can wager your derriere on that''.\n",
      "`` Ah, Monsieur, it is not my business to wager it.\n",
      "This took me so funny I had to look at her.\n",
      "`` Now isn't it better to smile''??\n",
      "Anyway, I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat, drew the cork, and passed it to her.\n",
      "`` Non, non'', she said, taking the bottle, `` not for that be sorry''.\n",
      "It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that, but I hadn't cared before.\n",
      "I wasn't going to lug around a glass.\n",
      "There wasn't much light in the blue dark, but I could see her well.\n",
      "Not good looking, but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive.\n",
      "We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other, and we stayed sober.\n",
      "We seemed to be drowsing, sadly, soberly, in the cold, cold air while the snow fell.\n",
      "Then she said, `` Allons'', and we got up and went to my hotel without another word.\n",
      "I think we were very tired, for we awoke at the same moment, deeply rested, surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows, which were wet where the rime had melted.\n",
      "`` Bon jour'', I said brightly, sitting up, which pulled the covers to her hips.\n",
      "Maybe closer to thirty, I thought.\n",
      "With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom.\n",
      "I gave it to the woman.\n",
      "`` Why, to brush your teeth''.\n",
      "I said with round eyes.\n",
      "I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself.\n",
      "`` Yes, because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush''.\n",
      "I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror.\n",
      "To my immense relief, she changed the subject in the next sentence: `` Shall we go to the Louvre today''??\n",
      "She smiled all the way to her wise, sad eyes, and drained her own.\n",
      "She understood sex anyway, and played at it well.\n",
      "We went to the Louvre for a few hours, then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre.\n",
      "I thought that was pretty humorous, but I didn't laugh.\n",
      "She would not stop to read them in American Express, as many were doing, sitting on benches or leaning against the walls, but pushed her way out into the street.\n",
      "In her mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully, almost exhaustingly, to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above, telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked, aqueducts and tombs, here a cypress, there a pine, and all around the low blue hills.\n",
      "Pictures in old Latin books returned to her: the Appian Way Today, the Colosseum, the Arch of Constantine.\n",
      "Moreover, nursing various Stubblefields -- her aunt, then her mother, then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses( everybody could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick), Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot.\n",
      "England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again, and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics, she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight, to see all these places with her own eyes.\n",
      "The very night after her father's funeral she had thought, though never admitted to a soul: Now I can go.\n",
      "There's nothing to stop me now.\n",
      "Cars, taxis, buses, and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain.\n",
      "Glad to be alone, Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left.\n",
      "The azaleas were as large as shrubs, and their myriad blooms, many still tight in the bud, ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink, along with many white ones too.\n",
      "Marvelous, thought Theresa, climbing in her portly, well-bred way, for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything.\n",
      "In Rome, all over Europe, she intended to move very slowly indeed.\n",
      "Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down.\n",
      "The sun warmed her, as it seemed to be warming everything, perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches.\n",
      "Of course, one of them would have to go and do this!!\n",
      "Poor Cousin Elec, she thought, tears rising to sting in the sun, but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer??\n",
      "She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her.\n",
      "Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it, in her loose high old lady's script -- t's carefully crossed, but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope.\n",
      "Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield, Rome, Italy, on the envelope, had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka, Alabama, and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor.\n",
      "Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness, death, and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway.\n",
      "Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec, brother and sister -- unmarried, devoted, aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago.\n",
      "Two days before he was taken sick, Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas, and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died.\n",
      "I'm supposed to care as much now as then, as much here as there, she realized, with a sigh.\n",
      "This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome, Italy, on it.\n",
      "She refolded the letter, replaced it in its envelope, and turned with relief to one from her brother George.\n",
      "But alas George, when he had written, had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral.\n",
      "His own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted, and as for his grandchildren( he had one so far, still in diapers), he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all.\n",
      "A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand.\n",
      "Theresa had seen him through the right college, into the right fraternity, and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls, safely married to the right sort, however much in the early years of that match his wife, Anne, had not seemed to understand poor George.\n",
      "Could it just be, Theresa wondered, that Anne had understood only too well, and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull??\n",
      "As for Cousin Alexander Carraway, the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him( except his paper knife) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call -- first Papa, then Mother, then Theresa and George.\n",
      "There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot.\n",
      "He held his long clenched foot in both hands, and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey.\n",
      "`` Can you think of anything to do''??\n",
      "`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to!!\n",
      "Can you think of anything to do''??\n",
      "`` Drop a cold key down his back''.\n",
      "`` I just hope this happens to you someday'', said Cousin Elec, who was not at his best.\n",
      "He was younger than Theresa: she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes, while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused.\n",
      "Theresa shifted to a new page.\n",
      "`` Of course( George's letter continued), there are practical problems to be considered.\n",
      "Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it.\n",
      "Robbie and Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them, and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here, but I think she feels that she might be an imposition, especially as long as our Rosie is still in high school.\n",
      "The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is populated with -- Miss Edna Whittaker, for example.\n",
      "A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in.\n",
      "She got up, standing uncertainly for a moment, then moving aside to let go past her, talking, a group of young men.\n",
      "They wore shoes with pointed toes, odd to American eyes, and narrow trousers, and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick.\n",
      "Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome, and felt themselves to be so.\n",
      "The man did not wish to leave.\n",
      "He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them.\n",
      "Theresa turned away to escape, and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two.\n",
      "There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister, while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed American lady, carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag, ascending the steps alone.\n",
      "Theresa Stubblefield, still holding the family letters in one hand, realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's death and `` doing something'' about Cousin Emma.\n",
      "They were even, Anne and George, probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries'' and come home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September.\n",
      "Of course, it wasn't Anne and George's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another, and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa??\n",
      "The trouble is, Theresa thought, that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely, nothing here is supposed even to exist.\n",
      "They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow.\n",
      "It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac, Dickens, and Stendhal while Papa was dying, not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation.\n",
      "It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore.\n",
      "Then, with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself, she tore them in two.\n",
      "She became aware that two Italian workmen, carrying a large azalea pot, were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display.\n",
      "I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer.\n",
      "You can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus.\n",
      "And I've been told that just about every town, no matter what its size, has its Lucille Warren.\n",
      "Just as it has its Susan Dolan, though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that.\n",
      "They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission.\n",
      "My folks and my faith protected me from things like that.\n",
      "And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren.\n",
      "Much as I love you -- well, a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to -- to come across.\n",
      "I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren.\n",
      "My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that, who didn't hesitate to use her sex.\n",
      "It was a vivid, sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard, bringing some stuff Dad had ordered.\n",
      "He had an easy masculine grace about him, the kind that kids don't have, but that I had sometimes admired in other older men.\n"

      "His smile was quick, and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp.\n",
      "The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me, too.\n",
      "A man had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie.\n",
      "But he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will.\n",
      "And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that.\n",
      "He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy.\n",
      "`` I always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that.\n",
      "`` And'', I was ticking off the items on my fingers, `` swears too much and goes out with the boys, whoever they are, too much, and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold''.\n",
      "He'd just admitted it to me.\n",
      "Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love, and that was the way I wanted to keep it.\n",
      "But what had I done, trying to keep us pure??\n",
      "I had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman.\n",
      "So one week later, I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10.\n",
      "I was desperate to hold him, to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed, and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren.\n",
      "And, though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself, there was in me a growing desire, a sexual awareness, that Johnnie had set in motion, an awareness that no other man had ever triggered.\n",
      "Astonishingly enough, it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness, begging this man to make love to me.\n",
      "And I snuggled closer to the man I loved.\n",
      "I had had no wedding ceremony, no witnesses, no certificate of marriage, but I had all the joy that goes with them.\n",
      "I took great comfort from his words, and smiled to myself in the darkness.\n",
      "I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids, and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who, being thirty, brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about.\n",
      "I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love, and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God, my promise to remain pure until I was married.\n",
      "Wouldn't Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness??\n",
      "It wasn't Johnnie's fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable.\n",
      "Just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children, as any decent man would, that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too.\n",
      "And if I could contribute to that, I'd do it.\n",
      "He was plenty attentive, all right, but he behaved like a gentleman, and I figured that, emotionally, I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half.\n",
      "It wasn't, I was sure, a difference in age that came between people, but a difference in maturity.\n",
      "It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring.\n",
      "From the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming, members of the Young Christians' League, and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter.\n",
      "I'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now, but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days.\n",
      "But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group.\n",
      "I hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever.\n",
      "I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group.\n",

      "The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi;;\n",
      "but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew, too, that there was no pill to cure it.\n",
      "He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else, had watched her marry the somebody else, and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever, which was really piling it on.\n",
      "From now on, his was going to be a man's world: the North Woods, duck blinds at dawning, beer and poker and male secretaries.\n",
      "In these damp circumstances, he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia.\n",
      "He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby, awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker, bearing down on him.\n",
      "He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists.\n",
      "Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal, Peony being less than weatherproof.\n",
      "As for its being fine, day after tomorrow, he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again, with Vivian lost to him forever.\n",
      "He could imagine her at this minute, honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name, lounging on golden sands, looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss.\n",
      "All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon, a salami sandwich for lunch, and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long.\n",
      "He dozed, only to dream of Vivian, and woke, only to crash into the night table, bruising his other shin.\n",
      "He took a yellow pill, only to choke on it, and went for the salami, only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy.\n",
      "His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby, in her mania for color, had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in;;\n",
      "but on further investigation, the thing proved to be a sweater, of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets -- pale, pale pink and, according to the label, size thirty-four.\n",
      "Not that he had supposed, considering the evidence, that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol.\n",
      "He didn't want to encourage anything here;;\n",
      "But then, as he well knew, women are not guided by logic or common sense.\n",
      "Now, if this were Vivian next door to him and if, for some obscure female reason, she kept her clothes in the refrigerator, they would not be pink.\n",
      "Pink, Vivian once had told him, was for baby girls, and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy.\n",
      "`` What's that you say''??\n",
      "Just look at that sky.\n",
      "You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash, first sunny day.\n",

      "`` He's that peaked kind''.\n",
      "The sun, blazing hot as prophesied, was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties.\n",
      "He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony, Larkspur, and the rest.\n",
      "He got a red pill and a beer and then, on impulse, transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest'' on the wrapping.\n",
      "The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript: `` You're not at all well, are you''??\n",
      "Not that it was any of her business.\n",
      "`` It's none of my business'', said the next note, `` but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold, and she lived to be ninety-six.\n",
      "Why don't you try that''??\n",
      "He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.\n",
      "`` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice.\n",
      "He spent that afternoon on the beach, looking for a pale, browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit.\n",
      "He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky, turtle-neck sweaters.\n",
      "And he saw them all as he walked up and down.\n",
      "At two that morning, he was still walking -- up and down Peony, up and down the veranda, up and down the silent, moonlit beach.\n",
      "She felt, and said, that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves;;\n",
      "it was a tough world, and you had to be tough to hold your own.\n",
      "Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms, waiting for the fire in his back to subside, and used generous quantities of the hand lotion.\n",
      "The only thing, this lotion has glycerin in it, and that whitens the skin, so if you're so anxious to get a tan, you may not want to use it''.\n",
      "`` I'm not that anxious, but maybe that's why you're so fair''.\n",

      "He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches.\n",
      "Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher.\n",
      "This brought in everybody from both sides, while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar.\n",
      "Mike yelled to the catcher.\n",
      "He simply turned to Mike and smiled.\n",
      "This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said: `` I'll get that little bastard.\n",
      "In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head.\n",
      "All Deegan had to do was slide, fall away, but instead, he rammed into the catcher.\n",
      "Both fell heavily to the ground.\n",
      "Only Mike got to his feet.\n",
      "He went back to touch home plate, turned and walked to the dugout without looking back.\n",
      "The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer.\n",
      "Then, quickly, and a little nervously, the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room.\n",
      "When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said: `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch''.\n",
      "Phil Rossoff, seated next to Deegan, got up and moved to the other end of the bench.\n",
      "The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout.\n",
      "It began to look as if something was going to happen.\n",
      "Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side.\n",
      "The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike.\n",
      "`` That was a rotten thing to do''.\n",
      "Tell your guys not to block the plate''.\n",
      "`` You didn't have to ram him''.\n",
      "He turned and went back across the field to his dugout.\n",
      "He called in the pitcher who had been pitching, and a big, heavy, powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston.\n",
      "The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat.\n",
      "Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting.\n",
      "When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in.\n",
      "He shouted to the pitcher.\n",
      "He stood flat-footed in the box, but not very close to the plate now.\n",
      "Deegan dropped, got up, turned and, holding the bat with both hands up against his chest, began to walk slowly out to the mound.\n",
      "Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil.\n",
      "Mike went over to Phil and stood over him.\n",
      "Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face.\n",
      "`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club'', Phil said slowly.\n",
      "`` You trying to say I started the fight''??\n",
      "`` I'm not trying to say anything''.\n",
      "He sat down before Eddie's desk.\n",
      "`` The best thing for you to do'', Eddie said, `` is go home.\n",
      "Phil had to clear his throat.\n",
      "`` Sit down, sit down'', Eddie said.\n",
      "`` Now listen to me, Phil.\n",
      "You're not in the big leagues, but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there''??\n",
      "Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short.\n",
      "But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with.\n",
      "Eddie stood up abruptly, then sat down just as abruptly.\n",
      "I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it.\n",
      "Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there.\n",
      "And you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you''!!\n",
      "Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again.\n",
      "The leagues are full of guys like that''.\n",
      "What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that??\n",
      "`` Talk to Whitey Jackson''.\n",

      "`` That's the way to talk.\n",
      "What else did Eddie have to say''??\n",
      "His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him.\n",
      "When he was twelve he took to reading St. Augustine and Aquinas, then Lao-tse, Confucius, Mencius, Suzuki, Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers.\n",
      "He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled, then went to his room to read.\n",
      "Through quiet laughter his mother said, `` Don't speak to your father like that, Richard''.\n",
      "Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again.\n",
      "Although he still didn't speak to anyone, he grew fond of saying, `` The future lies in Asia'', when the opportunity arose, and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation, they said, for his life in Asian studies.\n",
      "He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes, the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala, and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country.\n",
      "His mother, who had seen little of him for four years, appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which, she herself having slight knowledge of it, had to be distrusted.\n",
      "She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home, talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested.\n",
      "She asked him and, laughing, she added, `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that, but I knew you'd like it''.\n",
      "`` Yes'', he lied to shorten the conversation, `` I still have it''.\n",
      "He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father, no matter the subject.\n",
      "He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and, trembling at having to open the big furnace, given them up to the flames.\n",
      "Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried.\n",
      "Richard left America with his clothes, his biwa and his image of Acala and, on the freighter which took him to Japan, he plucked at the biwa, trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard.\n",
      "During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure.\n",
      "He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water.\n",
      "It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it.\n",
      "In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York, except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend.\n",
      "An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her.\n",
      "He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo.\n",
      "In time, he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity.\n",
      "She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes, although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations.\n",
      "Have you ever been to Ryusenji''??\n",
      "Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation, but Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it.\n",
      "Sashimi was In, Samuel Burns had suggested, because it was too far Out to stay Out, even if it was a little pretentious.\n",
      "Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game, the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears.\n",
      "`` I shouldn't have been able to do that''.\n",
      "`` Well I was able to do it'', Charlotte said with no sign of irritation.\n",
      "You've never been to Ryusenji''??\n",
      "`` There's a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki''.\n",
      "And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there, next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo.\n",
      "Oh, that's what I meant to tell you.\n",
      "This is the interesting part, Richard'', she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking.\n",
      "`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold'' --\n",
      "`` And the water would be still colder'', Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it.\n",
      "Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light.\n",
      "He found himself trying to remember something, but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall.\n",
      "He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching.\n",
      "Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji, he was unable to put it together.\n",
      "That night, after leaving Charlotte's apartment, Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room.\n",
      "When he at last did go to his room, he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala, thinking first of Charlotte's tale of the man at Ryusenji, then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters.\n",
      "And the next morning, not sure of why he went, he took the train to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji.\n",
      "He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool.\n",
      "The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not, and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach.\n",
      "He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple, and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him.\n",
      "Into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple, to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze;;\n",
      "but the spirit he wished to call out would not, he knew, come in the person of the temple priest.\n",
      "The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination, and then Richard was shocked as, all at once, flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound, as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it.\n",
      "Then the flames were gone, the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently.\n",
      "Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple, never looking back.\n",
      "He walked all the miles back to his room.\n",
      "He seemed to have picked up a virus that day, because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot.\n",
      "He stayed home, reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji.\n",
      "But the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day.\n",
      "The cold lingered, making sleep difficult that night, and he remained in bed still the next morning, now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal, the wretched sound, the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life.\n",
      "All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at Fudomae.\n",
      "I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings.\n",
      "It had grown hot early that day, and I hoped that the boy, my brother's son, would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground, carrying the jar of cool water.\n",
      "The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water, and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along, to play with.\n",
      "He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing, tractor sounds with his lips.\n",
      "I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth, and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway, and when I looked again down the furrow, the snake was there.\n",
      "It lay half in the furrow and half out, and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch.\n",
      "I had never liked snakes much, I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one, but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful.\n",
      "I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out, hoping to frighten him with the noise, but the snake only flicked its black, forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel, without fright or concern.\n",
      "I let the engine idle then, and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it.\n",
      "I followed it, looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back, the colors clear and sharp and perfect, in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back, and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black.\n",
      "The colors were astonishing, clear and bright, and it was as if the body held a fire of its own, and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin, vivid and alive and warm.\n",
      "His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth.\n",
      "I had killed snakes before, when I was younger, but there had been no animal like this one, and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die.\n",
      "I picked him up, and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly, and I could feel the coolness of that radiant, fire-colored body, like splendid ice, and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him, like fieldmice swallowed whole might make.\n",
      "The body caressed through my hands like cool satin, and my hands, usually tanned and dark, were pale beside it, and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body.\n",
      "The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien, too, in that dry and dusty and uncolored field.\n",
      "I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks.\n",
      "I had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house.\n",
      "The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly, and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field, a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake.\n",
      "Even at that distance, with no sound but the sound of the tractor, I could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy.\n",
      "I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy, and I knew he could hear me, for the morning was clear and still, but he did not even hesitate in that brutal, murdering dance.\n",
      "I felt myself tremble, thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before, and I wanted to run down there and halt, if I could, that frenetic pirouette, catch the boy in the moment of his savagery, and save a glimmer, a remnant, of that which I remembered, but I knew it was already too late.\n",
      "I drove the tractor on, not looking down there;;\n",
      "I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on.\n",
      "My head began to ache, and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes, and I hated the job suddenly, and I thought, there are only moments when one sees beautiful things, and these are soon crushed, or they vanish.\n",
      "The boy waited at the corner, with the jar of water held up to me in his hands, and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning.\n",
      "I knew the boy well.\n",
      "He was my nephew, my brother's son, handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed, with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well.\n",
      "I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me.\n",
      "the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his.\n",
      "`` No, you cannot'', I said, pushing aside the water jar he offered to me.\n",
      "I pointed to the splintered, upright stake.\n",
      "`` Did you do that''??\n",
      "He tried to take my hand to show me.\n",
      "`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it, for no other reason''.\n",
      "`` It was beautiful'', I said, half to myself.\n",
      "The snake was hideous, and I remembered, even then, the cool, bright fire of it only a little while before, and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that, and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life.\n",
      "I wrenched the stake out, that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body, between the colored diamond crystals.\n",
      "I touched it and the coolness, the ice-feeling, was gone, and even then it moved a little, perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles, and I hoped that it was truly dead, so that I would not have to kill it.\n",
      "And then it moved a little more, and I knew the snake was dying, and I would have to kill it there.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I thought to the snake, for you were beautiful.\n",
      "I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head, not looking at it, to kill it at last, for it could never live.\n",
      "`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed''.\n",
      "He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes.\n",
      "He looked up at me, puzzled, and he swayed his head from side to side.\n",
      "I thought, you little brute, you nasty, selfish, little beast, with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes.\n",
      "I wanted to slap his face, to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth, and I decided then, very suddenly, what I would do.\n",
      "But due to the many applicants on file, would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation, interests and his qualifications for leadership??\n",
      "His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor, lawyer, merchant or chief.\n",
      "Imagine his son being that good in science!!\n",
      "He put down his pipe and started to type.\n",
      "`` In response to your letter, I can in good conscience recommend my son, David, in the field of leadership''.\n",
      "He stopped and looked at the picture of his son, the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College.\n",
      "He didn't have to be told his son looked like him.\n",
      "He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence.\n",
      "`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics, tennis and swimming.\n",
      "His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to'' --\n",
      "He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build.\n",
      "How do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do??\n",
      "That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club, `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer'' -- or a lawyer, or an editor??\n",
      "How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential, that he will find himself??\n",
      "Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter, rolled in a fresh sheet, and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head.\n",
      "What a production to make of a letter commending your own son!!\n",
      "He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics.\n",
      "He belonged to a social club, a civic group, little theater, swimming team, and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club.\n",
      "He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter.\n",
      "There, that did it.\n",
      "Then he met the grave eyes of his wife, Anne, from the photograph next to David's.\n",
      "Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything.\n"

      "Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory, for if she picked up, say, a pair of her panties, she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same.\n",
      "He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor.\n",

      "she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy, the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death.\n",
      "They acquired another electronics factory, a specialized ceramics company, an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators.\n",
      "Feeling his power, Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer.\n",
      "Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders, it was ripe for amalgamation, and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash, and never mind inevitable consequences.\n",

      "allied to them was Gerry, devoting much time to swaying her father, and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further.\n",
      "Freddy's backing dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit.\n",

      "His recent experience in motor car advertising, a love for cars of themselves, the existence of A-Z's useless Wisconsin set-up, exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick's that nobody would buy, and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it.\n",
      "Initially, Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging.\n",
      "They took nearly a month to investigate, marshal statistics, and put their arguments down in black and white.\n",
      "Taking Hamrick with him, William went to Mr. Willis.\n",
      "I'll have to call in the brain trust.\n",
      "Are you willing to run the gantlet??\n",
      "`` We'll be in there swinging'', William said, `` but in a way, sir, you've got to decide it yourself.\n",
      "You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and, besides, nobody else is going to have the courage.\n",
      "If they follow anyone, it'll have to be you''.\n",
      "I hate that.\n",
      "From shock and incredulity, most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity.\n",
      "`` You're leading Dad down the garden path''.\n",
      "`` Your garden, God damn it''!!\n",
      "We're here to transact business.\n",
      "Can't we put an end to this, Arthur''??\n",
      "`` I'm an advertising hustler, I admit, but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere.\n",
      "They tried to sell'em on economy and simple merit.\n",
      "We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age.\n",
      "Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon, before the tide changed, still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us, ready-made.\n",
      "Why not come down smartly in the world, in a chic fashion, with an Allstates-Zenith''??\n",
      "Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum.\n",
      "`` I know what I'm talking about in that department''.\n",
      "`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis.\n",
      "Good luck to you''.\n",
      "`` All the in-laws have got to have their day'', Adam said, and glared at William and Freddy in turn.\n",
      "`` I suppose I can never expect to call you' General' after that Washington episode''.\n",
      "It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco!!\n",
      "For it seems that Barco, fancying himself a ladies' man( and why not, after seven marriages??\n",
      "), had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: `` With your beard, dear, you ought to be in movies''!!\n",
      "Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge, rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft, and less than five minutes later, detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco.\n",
      "On their way, they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants.\n",
      "Finally, at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue, they learned that their man, having paused to get oil for his car, had asked about the route to San Diego.\n",
      "They headed in that direction and, at San Juan Capistrano By-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in, eating a hot tamale.\n",
      "At the moment, Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which, in their quest for the stolen lap rug, they proceeded to search.\n",
      "The robe, however, was missing, for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale.\n",
      "The detectives placed Barco under arrest and, without informing him of the nature of the charge, took him back to Hollywood for questioning.\n",
      "Thus it was that Barco, apprehended for mere larceny, now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered.\n",
      "During the return trip, Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases, such as: `` They're under sand dunes They're better off, I tell you I saved their souls''.\n",
      "The detective, commenting on Barco's behavior, felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut''!!\n",
      "However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft, Barco, in a fit of apprehension, made an attempt to take his own life.\n",
      "The attempt had failed because, when endeavoring to cut his wrists, this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood.\n",
      "The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him;;\n",
      "Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case.\n",
      "A man of vaulting ambition, with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles, nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity.\n",
      "It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide.\n",
      "Welch wanted to know why.\n",
      "Now Welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at.\n",
      "The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test.\n",
      "But with Welch's relentless pursuit of the subject, Barco finally `` broke'' and started confessing to one murder after another.\n",
      "By the time Barco reached the count of three, the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true.\n",
      "Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell.\n",
      "But to Welch's chagrin, the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's credulity in Barco's confession.\n",
      "It required strength, bravado, daring to commit murder.\n",
      "He stiffened and rose to his feet.\n",
      "`` Is that so''??\n",
      "I can lead you to every one of the bodies, and there ain't four, nor five, nor six of'em -- there's seven!!\n",
      "For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it, even in Hollywood.\n",
      "Barco, his state of apprehension gone, never to return, had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on.\n",
      "He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica.\n",
      "Stopping the cars at a fork in the road, he got out, paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills, and indicated a location.\n",
      "Orders were given to dig.\n",
      "With greater precision he again paced off a location, this time a little more to the left.\n",
      "The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object.\n",
      "His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another.\n",
      "Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour, and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him.\n",
      "It went to his head, and his ambition increased.\n",
      "It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible sensation into the case.\n",
      "I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand.\n",
      "It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl!!\n",
      "I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted.\n",
      "It wasn't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola's destruction.\n",
      "A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors -- or, even more serious perhaps, that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap.\n",
      "I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down.\n",
      "Viola had been urged to attend, by telephone, and not knowing the host or the character of the party, she had gone.\n",
      "She arrived late and as she entered the party, noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority;;\n",
      "Naturally, Viola had no wish to remain, but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival, in all politeness to her host.\n",
      "And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;;\n",
      "while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which, as Fate would have it, belonged to District Attorney Welch.\n",
      "As Viola sat there, a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and, as a prank, insert rosebuds between the toes.\n",
      "A little later the district attorney woke up, emerged from under the couch, looked at his watch, and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on `` The Civic Spirit of the Southland'', in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife, as president of the forum, was to preside.\n",
      "He made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off, neatly arranged his hair, and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed.\n",
      "Then, noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds, he made his way to the Byzantine room and, with his usual dignity, mounted the rostrum.\n",
      "The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined.\n",
      "During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked.\n",
      "In the first place, it was difficult for us to meet.\n",
      "We couldn't be seen together, for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names, and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl, no matter how innocent.\n",
      "I couldn't invite Viola to our house, for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her.\n",
      "Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values, but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it, which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her.\n",
      "But Mother insisted, for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts.\n",
      "In fact, it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi.\n",
      "Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad, and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school.\n",
      "But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi'' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home.\n",
      "However, such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial, that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world, Society, and even, alas, to my own mother.\n",
      "When I arrived at Viola's I was shown, to my surprise, into the kitchen.\n",
      "Viola greeted me, in checked apron, ladle in hand, and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner.\n",
      "There was to be roast chicken with dressing, giblet gravy, asparagus, new peas with a sprig of mint, creamed onions, and mashed potatoes -- all chosen, prepared, and cooked by Viola herself.\n",
      "I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem, but his agony could have been no greater.\n",
      "The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's tray to the dish pile, and by means of repeated threats, on an ascending scale, seeing that the girls dressed themselves, after a fashion.\n",
      "Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone, claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency.\n",
      "Somehow managing to get out a cool, poised, `` Won't you hold on a second, please'', I covered up the mouthpiece, and with more warmth and less poise, gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment, mostly the latter, including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia.\n",
      "I promised to illustrate the lecture, if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed.\n",
      "Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out, Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table, and various screeches, thuds, and giggles.\n",
      "Under the circumstances, I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone, but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening, and how important it was that Hank and I be there.\n",
      "I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen, and were playing quietly in the living room.\n",
      "It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet, instead of carrying out my threats.\n",
      "Resolving to get something done, I started in on the dishes.\n",
      "What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink.\n",
      "They looked so formidable, however, so demanding, that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again, this time about Francesca and her husband.\n",
      "We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time, they had called on us, after I met Fran at a PTA meeting, and had taken us in hand socially.\n",
      "They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners, and for information as to where to shop, which dentist, doctor, plumber, and sitter to call( not that there was much of a choice, since Catatonia was just a village;;\n",
      "It was during her `` writing'' period that she and Herb met and decided that they were in love.\n",
      "Bermuda was not in style that year.\n",
      "everyone was very high on Rome that year.\n",
      "`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children'', Fran had told me at our first meeting, `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands, but People Who Do Things''.\n",
      "Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored( guided by an eminent architect) and updated, and added on to.\n",
      "It was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room, paint in the painting room, play with blocks in the block house, and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time.\n",
      "Their two boys were `` well adjusted'' and, like their parents, always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences.\n",
      "It seemed, indeed, that their house was not so much a home, but rather a perfect stage set, and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play, and had talent enough to fill the roles competently, with nice understatement.\n",
      "She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy, and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs.\n",
      "I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally unreal.\n",
      "Anyone knows how a real, red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe!!\n",
      "After five minutes with Blanche, one might welcome the astringency of Grazie, who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's Perle Mesta.\n",
      "Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen, equal bosses, of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched.\n",
      "They were inseparable, not because they were fond of each other, but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other, as they were keen rivals for social leadership.\n",
      "She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive.\n",
      "She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration, appointments, paint, and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring;;\n",
      "Her uniform was of rich, raw silk, in a shade which matched her hair, skin, housepaint, and cats, and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless, she rather resembled a frozen fish stick.\n",
      "The husbands of these women and others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were, to me at least, indistinguishable.\n",
      "In deference to country-squirehood.\n",
      "I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds''!!\n",
      "These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs, while they gazed, misty-eyed with care, into the eyes of the person they were meeting.\n",
      "They were always leaping to light cigarettes, open car doors, fill plates or glasses, and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves `` Sanitary Bake Shops''.\n",
      "I sighed, thinking that among other things, people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85,000 yearly;;\n",
      "people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person'';;\n",
      "people who thought it was nice to be important, but not important to be nice;;\n",
      "well, not discussed him exactly, but said, `` Kafka''!!\n",
      "Reverently and raised their eyes, as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka, which they were, because they had no opinions about Kafka, not having read Kafka.\n",
      "They were, I felt, people invariably trying to prove not who, but what they were, and trying to determine what, not who, others were.\n",
      "Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime, I brought myself back to the tasks at hand.\n",
      "Then, I remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week.\n",
      "They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast''.\n",
      "I dug around and found a mix, and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food cake with chocolate icing.\n",
      "The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing.\n",
      "Needless to say, I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise.\n",
      "How dared they demand to `` snoop'' in private financial records, disbursements, confidential contracts and agreements??\n",
      "'' My impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.\n",
      "But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation??\n",
      "The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome, sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of `` Soak the rich'!!\n",
      "After an unspeakable siege, lasting the better part of two months, it was announced that the studio `` owed'' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I, who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict, was `` stung'' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out'' all but a fraction of my poor, hard-come-by savings.\n",
      "It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional.\n",
      "I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court( 1937), Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen'' had done their `` dirty work'' all too well, even going so far as to attempt to `` pack'' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me.\n",
      "Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers, `` toadies'' and sycophants of the `` bench'' against me, but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me!!\n",
      "I was ready, like Portia, to present my own brief.\n",
      "My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out''.\n",
      "Heywood Broun wrote: `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula'', and even F.D.R. had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine, America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh''.\n",
      "Not only were the court costs prohibitive, but I was subjected to crippling fines, in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts'' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow.\n",
      "My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary'', `` robber baroness'', and even `` traitor''!!\n",
      "I point now with pride to the fact that, long ere the Committee on Un-American Activities, the Minute Women, the Economic Council and other such notable `` watchdog'' organizations were so much as heard of, I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against communism, fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism'' against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA, PWA, WPA, CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F.D.R. employed secretly, through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief'' checks.\n",
      "Needless to say, my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period.\n",
      "Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself'' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth'', no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune, her reputation, her livelihood, her home and her nation itself are all imperilled.\n",
      "Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar'' winning performances.\n",
      "Having( through my unflagging effort and devotion) achieved stardom, a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote, Letch proceeded to neglect them all.\n",
      "Never a `` quick study'', he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines'' and many a mile of film was wasted, many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty, forty, fifty times because Miss Poitrine's co-star and `` helpmate'' had never learned his part.\n",
      "Each time Letch `` went up'' in his `` lines'', I was the one to be patient, helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament, profanity and abuse, blaming others, going into `` sulks'' and, on more occasions than I care to count, storming off the `` set'' for the rest of the day.\n",
      "As for his finances, I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` salted away''.\n",
      "( But that is another story.\n",
      "More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers, `` bookies'', loan `` sharks'', gangsters, `` thugs'' and `` finger men'' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses, `` or else'' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu.\n",
      "And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls, with the commonest of accents, telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children!!\n",
      "Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter.\n",
      "I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around.\n",
      "Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and, in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch, I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear, so there was no place to put her, anyhow.\n",
      "( I sometimes feel that God, in His infinite wisdom, wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory.\n",
      "The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed, only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant;;\n",
      "a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's, on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet'', leaving me `` high and dry'' to get home as best I could.\n",
      "As Mrs. Letch Feeley, was it any wonder that I, once the social arbiter of Filmdom, was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires, the Coopers, the Gables, the Colmans, the Rathbones, the Taylors, the Thalbergs and such devout, closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys??\n",
      "Our last joint venture, Sainted Lady, a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini, and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November, 1938, was a fiasco from start to finish.\n",
      "But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble, I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light'' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini.\n",
      "Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made'' to his specifications, a role eventually cut down to three short speeches??\n",
      "Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over'', uncooperative, rude and insulting.\n",
      "Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me, the notices were few and unfavorable.\n",
      "Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote: `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood''.\n",
      "In a rare fit of anger and spite, I `` farmed out'' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.\n",
      "It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther, of all things!!\n",
      "At the same time, however, I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up, Sir Gauntley Pratt, to do a `` quickie'' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess, in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and, unbeknownst to anyone, is still occupied by an eccentric maniac.\n",
      "It was a `` potboiler'' made on a `` shoestring'' and not the sort of film I like, as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal.\n",
      "( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up'' remarkably well, even twenty years later.\n",
      "I really loved that boy, and, in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful, wonderful person Letch had once been, I took my troubles to Momma, hoping that her earthy advice would help me.\n",
      "`` If I could only think of something at the studio, near me, to absorb his boundless energy'', I said.\n",
      "Her reply stung me, but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference.\n",
      "Up to date, however, his garden was still more or less of a mess, he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it.\n",
      "It wasn't his fault that these things were so.\n",
      "The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately.\n",
      "Then, at last, his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read, or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon, accompanied by his dogs.\n",
      "Then they had always been romping around him on these walks, yelping with delight, dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions, returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws.\n",
      "Dogs did something to one's ego.\n",
      "They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys.\n",
      "Regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be, you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference.\n",

      "It worried him, this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day.\n",

      "And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement: reading, roaming, gardening, lying on his back and watching the clouds go by, was because he didn't want to do them.\n",

      "The effect, needless to say, is almost terrifying, and though at times a bit obscure, the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the `` repressed'' movie-goer.\n",
      "Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August, 1916, will certainly welcome his return to public notice;;\n",
      "and it is not unlikely that, even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years, so has the erudite, ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory'' of neglect.\n",
      "A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis'' movement in the Baslot.\n",
      "Not only was Haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw, but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride.\n",
      "For example, to move( as the score requires) from the lowest F-major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds, not skipping, at the same time, even one of the 407 fingerings, seems a feat too absurd to consider, and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage.\n",
      "We would have preferred, however, to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording, since it mars an otherwise sober, if not lofty, performance.\n",

      "Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half), the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention.\n",
      "The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them, asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie, gets a plate of English muffins instead.\n",
      "Leaving the theatre after the performance, I had a flash of intuition that life, after all( as Rilke said), is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee, and that this unpretentious, moving, clever, bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired.\n",
      "A biting, pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life, the piece has been set by Mlle Lagoon to a sumptuous score( a single motif played over and over by four thousand French horns) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul Sartre.\n",
      "Done in the modern style of a `` confession'', Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know, and, more important, love his mother's pet salamander, Alicia.\n",
      "It is not an entirely happy book, as Mrs. Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and, in retaliation, refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass.\n",
      "This brief resume hardly does the book justice, but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time.\n",
      "Opera in the Grand Tradition, along with mah-jongg, seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback.\n",
      "Fing, a lean, chiseled, impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke, is responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi's earliest, most raucous opera, Nabisco, a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno version of `` Volare''.\n",
      "Miss Pulova has a voice that Maria Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver'', and her round, opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie.\n",

      "Soaring to stardom along with him, Margo Felicity Brighetti, a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet, turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic.\n",
      "We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement.\n",
      "And it is thought by many who think about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet, progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso, and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De Kooning.\n",
      "`` I paint the nothing'', he said once to Franz Kline and myself, `` the nothing that is behind the something, the inexpressible, unpaintable' tick' in the unconscious, the' spirit' of the moment resting forever, suspended like a huge balloon, in non-time''.\n",
      "It is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The Invasion of Cuba''.\n",
      "The sweep of space, the delicate counterbalance of the white masses, the over-all completeness and unity, the originality and imagination, all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece.\n",
      "I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this, and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas'', which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity.\n",
      "It is, I am reliably given to understand, the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost;;\n",
      "i.e., burglars who rob while the tenants are absent, in contrast to hot-slough prowlers, those who work while the occupants are home.\n",
      "Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess, you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior.\n",
      "I merely draw an etymological distinction, hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman.\n",
      "Above all, disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence, to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art, or to shame you into rectitude.\n",
      "My object, rather, is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you, far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict.\n",
      "You have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign, so vindictive, that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them.\n",
      "As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations, permit me to recapitulate them briefly.\n",
      "Hastening to the attic, the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast, you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet, some khaki pants, and the like, and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there.\n",
      "What you were looking for( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens) eludes me, but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak Victrola.\n",
      "You danced two tangos and a paso doble, which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu.\n",
      "You then descended one story, glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit, by the way -- and, returning to the ground floor, entered the master bedroom.\n",
      "Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby, you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood, which, along with two box Kodaks, you added to your haul.\n",
      "Then, having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on, you lammed out the front door, considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover.\n",
      "So much for the tiresome facts, as familiar to you, I'm sure, as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake.\n",
      "The foregoing, aided by several clues I'll withhold to keep you on your toes, will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert, but before they close in, gird yourselves, I repeat, for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless.\n",
      "Fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature, as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches.\n",
      "If, however, it would help to intensify your anguish, I can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance.\n",
      "Now, you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods, much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest.\n",
      "Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers.\n",
      "Hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment;;\n",
      "they expired amid indescribable fantods, imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration.\n",
      "Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead, as a dealer in Khartoum assured me, I am not competent to say.\n",
      "But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali, the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish, that I particularly call to your attention.\n",
      "Oddly enough, this is an amulet against housebreakers, presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949.\n",
      "Neither do I, but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate, and I'll do as much for you.\n",
      "Furthermore -- and this, to me, strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot.\n",
      "In that case, listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss.\n",
      "In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay, and occasionally, to make merit, my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap.\n",
      "After a while, we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it.\n",
      "Our suspicions eventually centered, by the process of elimination, on a grocer's boy, a thoroughly bad hat, who delivered cartons to the people overhead.\n",
      "I learned, for example, that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and, in winter, of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet.\n",
      "sometimes he would be up before dawn, clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us, and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws.\n",
      "Evenings, he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico& Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing `` O Sole Mio''.\n",

      "Not long ago, I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City;;\n",
      "he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once, clearly a man in extremis.\n",
      "`` See that guy''??\n",
      "However one looks at it, therefore, I'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy.\n",
      "The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move;;\n",
      "you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva.\n",
      "Additionally, since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue, yaws, Delhi boil, the Granville wilt, liver fluke, bilharziasis, and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused, you mustn't expect to be lionized socially.\n",
      "My advice, if you live long enough to continue your vocation, is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic, pass it up -- it's nothing but a headache.\n",
